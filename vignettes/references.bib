We introduce the single-sample Noob ({ssNoob}) method, a normalization procedure suitable for incremental preprocessing of individual methylation arrays and conclude that this method should be used when integrating data from multiple generations of Inﬁnium methylation arrays. We show how to use reference 450k datasets to estimate cell type composition of samples on {EPIC} arrays. The cumulative effect of these updates is to ensure that minﬁ provides the tools to best integrate existing and forthcoming Illumina methylation array data.},

We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of {DNA} methylation in a cohort of low-grade gliomas and their patient-matched recurrences. Genes transcriptionally upregulated through promoter hypomethylation during malignant progression to high-grade glioblastoma were enriched in cell cycle function, evolving in parallel with genetic alterations that deregulate the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Moreover, phyloepigenetic relationships robustly recapitulated phylogenetic patterns inferred from somatic mutations.

	abstract = {Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of brain tumors with distinct biological and clinical properties. Despite advances in surgical techniques and clinical regimens, treatment of high-grade glioma remains challenging and carries dismal rates of therapeutic success and overall survival. Challenges include the molecular complexity of gliomas, as well as inconsistencies in histopathological grading, resulting in an inaccurate prediction of disease progression and failure in the use of standard therapy. The updated 2016 World Health Organization ({WHO}) classification of tumors of the central nervous system reflects a refinement of tumor diagnostics by integrating the genotypic and phenotypic features, thereby narrowing the defined subgroups.The new classification recommends molecular diagnosis of isocitrate dehydrogenase ({IDH}) mutational status in gliomas. {IDH}-mutant gliomas manifest the cytosine-phosphate-guanine ({CpG}) island methylator phenotype (G-{CIMP}). Notably, the recent identification of clinically relevant subsets of G-{CIMP} tumors (G-{CIMP}-high and G-{CIMP}-low) provides a further refinement in glioma classification that is independent of grade and histology. This scheme may be useful for predicting patient outcome and may be translated into effective therapeutic strategies tailored to each patient. In this review, we highlight the evolution of our understanding of the G-{CIMP} subsets and how recent advances in characterizing the genome and epigenome of gliomas may influence future basic and translational research.},

	abstract = {Background: The analysis of {DNA} methylation is a key component in the development of personalized treatment approaches. A common way to measure {DNA} methylation is the calculation of beta values, which are bounded variables of the form M/(M + U) that are generated by Illumina’s 450k {BeadChip} array. The statistical analysis of beta values is considered to be challenging, as traditional methods for the analysis of bounded variables, such as M-value regression and beta regression, are based on regularity assumptions that are often too strong to adequately describe the distribution of beta values.
Results: We develop a statistical model for the analysis of beta values that is derived from a bivariate gamma distribution for the signal intensities M and U. By allowing for possible correlations between M and U, the proposed model explicitly takes into account the data-generating process underlying the calculation of beta values. Using simulated data and a real sample of {DNA} methylation data from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall cohort study, we demonstrate that the proposed model fits our data significantly better than beta regression and M-value regression.
Conclusion: The proposed model contributes to an improved identification of associations between beta values and covariates such as clinical variables and lifestyle factors in epigenome-wide association studies. It is as easy to apply to a sample of beta values as beta regression and M-value regression.},

Traditional analyses that associate {DNAm} alterations with phenotypes suffer from multiple hypothesis testing and multi-collinearity due to the high-dimensional, continuous, interacting and non-linear nature of the data. Deep learning analyses have shown much promise to study disease heterogeneity. {DNAm} deep learning approaches have not yet been formalized into user-friendly frameworks for execution, training, and interpreting models. Here, we describe {MethylNet}, a {DNAm} deep learning method that can construct embeddings, make predictions, generate new data, and uncover unknown heterogeneity with minimal user supervision.
Results: The results of our experiments indicate that {MethylNet} can study cellular differences, grasp higher order information of cancer sub-types, estimate age and capture factors associated with smoking in concordance with known differences.
Conclusion: The ability of {MethylNet} to capture nonlinear interactions presents an opportunity for further study of unknown disease, cellular heterogeneity and aging processes.},

We present our experience that combines a conventional molecular diagnostic approach with the complementary use of a {DNA} methylation-based classification tool, for adult brain tumours originating from local as well as national referrals. We report the frequency of {IDH} mutations in a large cohort of nearly 1550 patients, {EGFR} amplifications in almost 1900 {IDH}-wildtype glioblastomas, and histone mutations in 70 adult gliomas. We demonstrate how additional methylation-based classification has changed and improved our diagnostic approach. Of the 325 cases referred for methylome testing, 179 (56\%) had a calibrated score of 0.84 and higher and were included in the evaluation. In these 179 samples, the diagnosis was changed in 45 (25\%), refined in 86 (48\%) and confirmed in 44 cases (25\%). In addition, the methylation arrays contain copy number information that usefully complements the methylation profile. For example, {EGFR} amplification which is 95\% concordant with our Real-Time {PCR}-based copy number assays. We propose here a diagnostic algorithm that integrates histology, conventional molecular tests and methylation arrays.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years the Illumina {HumanMethylation}450 ({HM}450) {BeadChip} has provided a user-friendly platform to profile {DNA} methylation in human samples. However, {HM}450 lacked coverage of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the {MethylationEPIC} ({EPIC}) {BeadChip}, with new content specifically designed to target these regions. We have used {HM}450 and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing ({WGBS}) to perform a critical evaluation of the new {EPIC} array platform.
Results: {EPIC} covers over 850,000 {CpG} sites, including {\textgreater}90 \% of the {CpGs} from the {HM}450 and an additional 413,743 {CpGs}. Even though the additional probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58 \% of {FANTOM}5 enhancers, only 7 \% distal and 27 \% proximal {ENCODE} regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons of regulatory elements from {EPIC} and {WGBS} show that a single {EPIC} probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory elements showing variable methylation across the region. However, overall data from the {EPIC} array at single loci are highly reproducible across technical and biological replicates and demonstrate high correlation with {HM}450 and {WGBS} data. We show that the {HM}450 and {EPIC} arrays distinguish differentially methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated list of probes whose signal could be affected by cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation.
Conclusion: The {EPIC} array is a significant improvement over the {HM}450 array, with increased genome coverage of regulatory regions and high reproducibility and reliability, providing a valuable tool for high-throughput human methylome analyses from diverse clinical samples.},

Contradictory results were validated by pyrosequencing.
Results: The inter-method reliability reached 77\% (kappa-coefficient: 0.58) when also cases with an inconclusive result in one or the other method were taken into account. When only cases with conclusive results in both methods were considered, a very high inter-method reliability of 91\% (kappa-coefficient: 0.86) could be achieved. For “methylated” cases, no contradictory results were obtained. For the remaining two cases with discrepant results subsequent pyrosequencing analyses spoke in favor of each previously applied method once.

Molecular biomarkers including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 ({IDH}1/2) mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and O6methylguanine-{DNA}-methyltransferase ({MGMT}) promoter methylation may improve prognostication and guide treatment decisions for patients with World Health Organization ({WHO}) anaplastic gliomas. At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Inﬁnium {HumanMethylation}450 {BeadChip} arrays ({HM}450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation proﬁles and genome-wide {DNA} copy number changes. Algorithms have been developed to detect the glioma {CpG} island methylator phenotype ({GCIMP}) associated with {IDH}1/2 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and {MGMT} promoter methylation using a single assay.
Methods. Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n ¼ 115 patients) of the {NOA}-04 trial.
Results. Concordance for {IDH} and 1p/19q status was very high: In 92\% of samples, the {HM}450 and reference data agreed. In discordant samples, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the {HM}450 analysis. The {HM}450-derived {MGMT}-{STP}27 model to calculate {MGMT} promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a signiﬁcantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-speciﬁc {PCR}, with 87 of 91 G-{CIMP} tumors predicted as {MGMT} promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of discordant samples conﬁrmed the {HM}450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases.
Conclusions. G-{CIMP} and 1p/19q codeletion are reliably detectable by {HM}450 analysis and are associated with prognosis in the {NOA}04 trial. For {MGMT}, {HM}450 suggests promoter methylation in the vast majority of G-{CIMP} tumors, which is supported by pyrosequencing.},

For the first time, the {WHO} classification of {CNS} tumors uses molecular parameters in addition to histology to define many tumor entities, thus formulating a concept for how {CNS} tumor diagnoses should be structured in the molecular era. As such, the 2016 {CNS} {WHO} presents major restructuring of the diffuse gliomas, medulloblastomas and other embryonal tumors, and incorporates new entities that are defined by both histology and molecular features, including glioblastoma, {IDH}-wildtype and glioblastoma, {IDH}-mutant; diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M–mutant; {RELA} fusion–positive ependymoma; medulloblastoma, {WNT}-activated and medulloblastoma, {SHH}-activated; and embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes, C19MC-altered. The 2016 edition has added newly recognized neoplasms, and has deleted some entities, variants and patterns that no longer have diagnostic and/or biological relevance. Other notable changes include the addition of brain invasion as a criterion for atypical meningioma and the introduction of a soft tissue-type grading system for the now combined entity of solitary fibrous tumor / hemangiopericytoma—a departure from the manner by which other {CNS} tumors are graded. Overall, it is hoped that the 2016 {CNS} {WHO} will facilitate clinical, experimental and epidemiological studies that will lead to improvements in the lives of patients with brain tumors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the eﬀect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a eﬃciency and/or eﬀectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We speciﬁcally examine the behavior of the commonly used Lk norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lk norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can signiﬁcantly improve the eﬀectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

We show empirical evidence for exclusion criteria for underperforming probes, providing a sounder basis than current ad hoc criteria for exclusion. In addition, we describe novel probe uses, exempliﬁed by the addition of a total of 1052 {SNP} probes to the existing 59 explicit {SNP} probes on the {EPIC} array and the use of these probes to predict ethnicity. Finally, we present an innovative out-of-band color channel application for the dual use of 62 371 probes as internal bisulﬁte conversion controls.},

	shorttitle = {Intratumor {DNA} methylation heterogeneity in glioblastoma},
	abstract = {Background.  A feature of glioblastoma ({GBM}) is cellular and molecular heterogeneity, both within and between tumors. This variability causes a risk for sampling bias and potential tumor escape from future targeted therapy. Heterogeneous intratumor gene expression in {GBM} is well documented, but little is known regarding the epigenetic heterogeneity. Variability in {DNA} methylation within tumors would have implications for diagnostics, as methylation can be used for tumor classification, subtyping, and determination of the clinically used biomarker O6-methylguanine-{DNA} methyltransferase ({MGMT}) promoter methylation. We therefore aimed to profile the intratumor {DNA} methylation heterogeneity in {GBM} and its effect on diagnostic properties.
Methods. Three to 4 spatially separated biopsies per tumor were collected from 12 {GBM} patients. We performed genome-wide {DNA} methylation analysis and investigated intratumor variation.
Results.  All samples were classified as {GBM} isocitrate dehydrogenase ({IDH}) wild type (wt)/mutated by methylation profiling, but the subclass differed within 5 tumors. Some {GBM} samples exhibited higher {DNA} methylation differences within tumors than between, and many cytosine-phosphate-guanine ({CpG}) sites (mean: 17 000) had different methylation levels within the tumors. {MGMT} methylation status differed in {IDH} mutated patients (1/1).
Conclusions. We demonstrated that intratumor {DNA} methylation heterogeneity is a feature of {GBM}. Although all biopsies were classified as {GBM} {IDH} wt/mutated by methylation analysis, the assigned subclass differed in samples from the same patient. The observed heterogeneity within tumors is important to consider for methylationbased biomarkers and future improvements in stratification of {GBM} patients.},

	abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity ({ITH}) of genomic alterations may impact prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma ({LUAD}). Here, we investigate {ITH} of somatic copy number alterations ({SCNAs}), {DNA} methylation, and point mutations in lung cancer driver genes in 292 tumor samples from 84 patients with {LUAD}. {LUAD} samples show substantial {SCNA} and methylation {ITH}, and clonal architecture analyses present congruent evolutionary trajectories for {SCNAs} and {DNA} methylation aberrations. Methylation {ITH} mapping to gene promoter areas or tumor suppressor genes is low. Moreover, {ITH} composed of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms altering the same cancer driver genes is shown in several tumors. To quantify {ITH} for valid statistical association analyses, we develope an average pairwise {ITH} index ({APITH}), which does not depend on the number of samples per tumor. Both {APITH} indexes for {SCNAs} and methylation aberrations show significant associations with poor prognosis. This study further establishes the important clinical implications of genetic and epigenetic {ITH} in {LUAD}.},

	abstract = {The methylation status of the O(6)-methylguanine-{DNA} methyltransferase ({MGMT}) gene is an important predictive biomarker for benefit from alkylating agent therapy in glioblastoma. Our model {MGMT}-{STP}27 allows prediction of the methylation status of the {MGMT} promoter using data from the Illumina's Human Methylation {BeadChips} ({HM}-27K and {HM}-450K) that is publically available for many cancer data sets. Here, we investigate the impact of the context of genetic and epigenetic alterations and tumor type on the classification and report on technical aspects, such as robustness of cutoff definition and preprocessing of the data. The association between gene copy number variation, predicted {MGMT} methylation, and {MGMT} expression revealed a gene dosage effect on {MGMT} expression in lower grade glioma (World Health Organization grade {II}/{III}) that in contrast to glioblastoma usually carry two copies of chromosome 10 on which {MGMT} resides (10q26.3). This implies some {MGMT} expression, potentially conferring residual repair function blunting the therapeutic effect of alkylating agents. A sensitivity analyses corroborated the performance of the original cutoff for various optimization criteria and for most data preprocessing methods. Finally, we propose an R package mgmtstp27 that allows prediction of the methylation status of the {MGMT} promoter and calculation of appropriate confidence and/or prediction intervals. Overall, {MGMT}-{STP}27 is a robust model for {MGMT} classification that is independent of tumor type and is adapted for single sample prediction.},

We identify 299 driver genes with implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequenceand structure-based analyses identiﬁed {\textgreater}3,400 putative missense driver mutations supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation conﬁrmed 60\%–85\% of predicted mutations as likely drivers. We found that {\textgreater}300 {MSI} tumors are associated with high {PD}-1/{PD}-L1, and 57\% of tumors analyzed harbor putative clinically actionable events. Our study represents the most comprehensive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to date and will serve as a blueprint for future biological and clinical endeavors.},

	abstract = {Problems of genome rearrangement are central in both evolution and cancer. Most evolutionary scenarios have been studied under the assumption that the genome contains a single copy of each gene. In contrast, tumor genomes undergo deletions and duplications, and thus, the number of copies of genes varies. The number of copies of each segment along a chromosome is called its copy number proﬁle ({CNP}). Understanding {CNP} changes can assist in predicting disease progression and treatment. To date, questions related to distances between {CNPs} gained little scientiﬁc attention. Here we focus on the following fundamental problem, introduced by Schwarz et al.: given two {CNPs}, u and v, compute the minimum number of operations transforming u into v, where the edit operations are segmental deletions and ampliﬁcations. We establish the computational complexity of this problem, showing that it is solvable in linear time and constant space.},

	abstract = {Intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity is the result of ongoing evolutionary change within each cancer. The expansion of genetically distinct sub-clonal populations may explain the emergence of drug resistance, and if so, would have prognostic and predictive utility. However, methods for objectively quantifying tumour heterogeneity have been missing and are particularly difficult to establish in cancers where predominant copy number variation prevents accurate phylogenetic reconstruction owing to horizontal dependencies caused by long and cascading genomic rearrangements. To address these challenges, we present {MEDICC}, a method for phylogenetic reconstruction and heterogeneity quantification based on a Minimum Event Distance for Intra-tumour Copy-number Comparisons. Using a transducer-based pairwise comparison function, we determine optimal phasing of major and minor alleles, as well as evolutionary distances between samples, and are able to reconstruct ancestral genomes. Rigorous simulations and an extensive clinical study show the power of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in reconstruction accuracy, and additionally allows unbiased numerical quantification of tumour heterogeneity. Accurate quantification and evolutionary inference are essential to understand the functional consequences of tumour heterogeneity. The {MEDICC} algorithms are independent of the experimental techniques used and are applicable to both next-generation sequencing and array {CGH} data.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-2819-7},
	abstract = {Background: Illumina’s {HumanMethylation}450 arrays provide the most cost-effective means of high-throughput {DNA} methylation analysis. As with other types of microarray platforms, technical artifacts are a concern, including background fluorescence, dye-bias from the use of two color channels, bias caused by type I/{II} probe design, and batch effects. Several approaches and pipelines have been developed, either targeting a single issue or designed to address multiple biases through a combination of methods. We evaluate the effect of combining separate approaches to improve signal processing.
Results: In this study nine processing methods, including both within- and between- array methods, are applied and compared in four datasets. For technical replicates, we found both within- and between-array methods did a comparable job in reducing variance across replicates. For evaluating biological differences, within-array processing always improved differential {DNA} methylation signal detection over no processing, and always benefitted from performing background correction first. Combinations of within-array procedures were always among the best performing methods, with a slight advantage appearing for the between-array method Funnorm when batch effects explained more variation in the data than the methylation alterations between cases and controls. However, when this occurred, {RUVm}, a new batch correction method noticeably improved reproducibility of differential methylation results over any of the signal-processing methods alone.
Conclusions: The comparisons in our study provide valuable insights in preprocessing {HumanMethylation}450 {BeadChip} data. We found the within-array combination of Noob + {BMIQ} always improved signal sensitivity, and when combined with the {RUVm} batch-correction method, outperformed all other approaches in performing differential {DNA} methylation analysis. The effect of the data processing method, in any given data set, was a function of both the signal and noise.},

	abstract = {Background. Genetic and epigenetic proﬁling of glioblastomas has provided a comprehensive list of altered cancer genes of which only O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase ({MGMT}) methylation is used thus far as a predictive marker in a clinical setting. We investigated the prognostic signiﬁcance of genetic and epigenetic alterations in glioblastoma patients. Methods. We screened 98 human glioblastoma samples for genetic and epigenetic alterations in 10 genes and chromosomal loci by {PCR} and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation ({MLPA}). We tested the association between these genetic and epigenetic alterations and glioblastoma patient survival. Subsequently, we developed a 2-gene survival predictor. Results. Multivariate analyses revealed that mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ({IDH}1), promoter methylation of {MGMT}, irradiation dosage, and Karnofsky Performance Status ({KFS}) were independent prognostic factors. A 2-gene predictor for glioblastoma survival was generated. Based on the genetic and epigenetic status of {IDH}1 and {MGMT}, glioblastoma patients were stratiﬁed into 3 clinically different genotypes: glioblastoma patients with {IDH}1mt/{MGMTmet} had the longest survival, followed by patients with {IDH}1mt/{MGMTunmet} or {IDH}1wt/{MGMTmet}, and patients with {IDH}1wt/{MGMTunmet} had the shortest survival. This 2-gene predictor was an independent prognostic factor and performed signiﬁcantly better in predicting survival than either {IDH}1 mutations or {MGMT} methylation alone. The predictor was validated in 3 external datasets. Discussion. The combination of {IDH}1 mutations and {MGMT} methylation outperforms either {IDH}1 mutations or {MGMT} methylation alone in predicting survival of glioblastoma patients. This information will help to increase our understanding of glioblastoma biology, and it may be helpful for baseline comparisons in future clinical trials.},

We analyzed genome-wide {DNA} methylation and copy-number calls from the same {DNA} assay in a cohort of healthy breast samples and age-matched normal samples collected adjacent to breast cancer. Using statistical methods to adjust for cell type heterogeneity, we show that {DNA} methylation changes can discriminate normal-adjacent from normal samples better than somatic copy-number variants. We validate this important ﬁnding in an independent dataset. These results suggest that {DNA} methylation alterations in the normal cell of origin may offer better cancer risk prediction and early detection markers than copy-number changes.},

We investigated and compared the epigenetic and genetic landscape of adult and pediatric T-{ALL} (n = 77) and T-{LBL} (n = 15) patient samples by high-resolution genome-wide {DNA} methylation and Copy Number Variation ({CNV}) {BeadChip} arrays. {DNA} methylation proﬁling identiﬁed the presence of {CpG} island methylator phenotype ({CIMP}) subgroups within both pediatric and adult T-{LBL} and T-{ALL}. An epigenetic signature of 128 differentially methylated {CpG} sites was identiﬁed, that clustered T-{LBL} and T-{ALL} separately. The most signiﬁcant differentially methylated gene loci included the {SGCE}/{PEG}10 shared promoter region, previously implicated in lymphoid malignancies. {CNV} analysis conﬁrmed overlapping recurrent aberrations between T-{ALL} and T-{LBL}, including 9p21.3 ({CDKN}2A/{CDKN}2B) deletions. A signiﬁcantly higher frequency of chromosome 13q14.2 deletions was identiﬁed in T-{LBL} samples (36\% in T-{LBL} vs. 0\% in T-{ALL}). This deletion, encompassing the {RB}1, {MIR}15A and {MIR}16-1 gene loci, has been reported as a recurrent deletion in B-cell malignancies. Our study reveals epigenetic and genetic markers that can distinguish between T-{LBL} and T-{ALL}, and deepen the understanding of the biology underlying the diverse disease localization.},

	abstract = {In the mammalian genome, {DNA} methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5 position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. {DNA} methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of transcription factor(s) to {DNA}. During development, the pattern of {DNA} methylation in the genome changes as a result of a dynamic process involving both de novo {DNA} methylation and demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique {DNA} methylation pattern that regulates tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will review the process of {DNA} methylation and demethylation in the nervous system. We will describe the {DNA} (de)methylation machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and noncoding {RNAs}. Intriguingly, postmitotic neurons still express {DNA} methyltransferases and components involved in {DNA} demethylation. Moreover, neuronal activity can modulate their pattern of {DNA} methylation in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise regulation of {DNA} methylation is essential for normal cognitive function. Indeed, when {DNA} methylation is altered as a result of developmental mutations or environmental risk factors, such as drug exposure and neural injury, mental impairment is a common side effect. The investigation into {DNA} methylation continues to show a rich and complex picture about epigenetic gene regulation in the central nervous system and provides possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

In this review, we examine the literature on early-life effects on epigenetic patterns, with special emphasis on social environmental influences. First, we review the basic biology of epigenetic modification of {DNA} and debate the role of early-life stressful, protective, and positive environments on gene-specific, system-specific, and whole-genome epigenetic patterns later in life. Second, we compare the epigenetic literatures of both humans and other animals and review the research linking epigenetic patterns to health in order to complete the mechanistic pathway. Third, we discuss physical environmental and social environmental effects, which have to date, generally not been jointly considered. Finally, we close with a discussion of the current state of the area’s research, its future direction, and its potential use in pediatric health.},

Here we identify N6-methyladenine as another form of {DNA} modification in mouse embryonic stem cells. Alkbh1 encodes a demethylase for N6-methyladenine. An increase of N6-methyladenine levels in Alkbh1-deficient cells leads to transcriptional silencing. N6-methyladenine deposition is inversely correlated with the evolutionary age of {LINE}-1 transposons; its deposition is strongly enriched at young ({\textless}1.5 million years old) but not old ({\textgreater}6 million years old) L1 elements. The deposition of N6-methyladenine correlates with epigenetic silencing of such {LINE}-1 transposons, together with their neighbouring enhancers and genes, thereby resisting the gene activation signals during embryonic stem cell differentiation. As young full-length {LINE}-1 transposons are strongly enriched on the X chromosome, genes located on the X chromosome are also silenced. Thus, N6-methyladenine developed a new role in epigenetic silencing in mammalian evolution distinct from its role in gene activation in other organisms. Our results demonstrate that N6-methyladenine constitutes a crucial component of the epigenetic regulation repertoire in mammalian genomes.},

This report contains the most up-to-date population-based data on primary brain tumors available and supersedes all previous reports in terms of completeness and accuracy. All rates are age-adjusted using the 2000 {US} standard population and presented per 100,000 population. The average annual age-adjusted incidence rate ({AAAIR}) of all malignant and non-malignant brain and other {CNS} tumors was 23.41 (Malignant {AAAIR} = 7.08, non-Malignant {AAAIR} = 16.33). This rate was higher in females compared to males (25.84 versus 20.82), Whites compared to Blacks (23.50 versus 23.34), and non-Hispanics compared to Hispanics (23.84 versus 21.28). The most commonly occurring malignant brain and other {CNS} tumor was glioblastoma (14.6\% of all tumors), and the most common non-malignant tumor was meningioma (37.6\% of all tumors). Glioblastoma was more common in males, and meningioma was more common in females. In children and adolescents (age 0–19 years), the incidence rate of all primary brain and other {CNS} tumors was 6.06. An estimated 86,010 new cases of malignant and non-malignant brain and other {CNS} tumors are expected to be diagnosed in the {US} in 2019 (25,510 malignant and 60,490 non-malignant). There were 79,718 deaths attributed to malignant brain and other {CNS} tumors between 2012 and 2016. This represents an average annual mortality rate of 4.42. The five-year relative survival rate following diagnosis of a malignant brain and other {CNS} tumor was 35.8\%, and the five-year relative survival rate following diagnosis of a non-malignant brain and other {CNS} tumors was 91.5\%.},

	abstract = {In mammalian cells, the replication of genetic and epigenetic information is directly coupled; however, little is known about the maintenance of epigenetic information in {DNA} repair. Using a laser microirradiation system to introduce {DNA} lesions at defined subnuclear sites, we tested whether the major {DNA} methyltransferase (Dnmt1) or one of the two de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b) are recruited to sites of {DNA} repair in vivo. Time lapse microscopy of microirradiated mammalian cells expressing {GFP}-tagged Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, or Dnmt3b1 together with red fluorescent protein-tagged proliferating cell nuclear antigen ({PCNA}) revealed that Dnmt1 and {PCNA} accumulate at {DNA} damage sites as early as 1 min after irradiation in S and non-S phase cells, whereas recruitment of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was not observed. Deletion analysis showed that Dnmt1 recruitment was mediated by the {PCNA}-binding domain. These data point to a direct role of Dnmt1 in the restoration of epigenetic information during {DNA} repair.},

One of the best-known lesions of the malignant cell is the transcriptional repression of tumor-suppressor genes by promoter {CpG} island hypermethylation. We are in the process of completing the molecular dissection of the entire epigenetic machinery involved in methylation-associated silencing, such as {DNA} methyltransferases, methyl-{CpG} binding domain proteins, histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, histone demethylases and Polycomb proteins. The first indications are also starting to emerge about how the combination of cellular selection and targeted pathways leads to abnormal {DNA} methylation. One thing is certain already, promoter {CpG} island hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes is a common hallmark of all human cancers. It affects all cellular pathways with a tumor-type specific profile, and in addition to classical tumor-suppressor and {DNA} repair genes, it includes genes involved in premature aging and {microRNAs} with growth inhibitory functions. The importance of hypermethylation events is already in evidence at the bedside of cancer patients in the form of cancer detection markers and chemotherapy predictors, and in the approval of epigenetic drugs for the treatment of hematological malignancies. In the very near future, the synergy of candidate gene approaches and large-scale epigenomic technologies, such as methyl-{DIP}, will yield the complete {DNA} hypermethylome of cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Gene function in cancer can be disrupted either through genetic alterations, which directly mutate or delete genes, or epigenetic alterations, which alter the heritable state of gene expression. The latter events are mediated by formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin states around gene transcription start sites and an associated gain of methylation in normally unmethylated {CpG} islands in these regions. The genes affected include over half of the tumor suppressor genes that cause familial cancers when mutated in the germline; the selective advantage for genetic and epigenetic dysfunction in these genes is very similar. The aberrant methylation can begin very early in tumor progression and mediate most of the important pathway abnormalities in cancer including loss of cell cycle control, altered function of transcription factors, altered receptor function, disruption of normal cell–cell and cell–substratum interaction, inactivation of signal transduction pathways, loss of apoptotic signals and genetic instability. The active role of the aberrant methylation in transcriptional silencing of genes is becoming increasingly understood and involves a synergy between the methylation and histone deacetylase ({HDAC}) activity. This synergy can be mediated directly by {HDAC} interaction with {DNA} methylating enzymes and by recruitment through complexes involving methyl-cytosine binding proteins. In the translational arena, the promoter hypermethylation changes hold great promise as {DNA} tumor markers and their potentially reversible state creates a target for cancer therapeutic strategies involving gene reactivation.},

	abstract = {Aims: Studies of {DNA} methylomes hold enormous promise for biomedicine but are hampered by the technological challenges of analyzing many samples cost-effectively. Recently, a major extension of the previous Infinium {HumanMethylation}27 {BeadChip}® (Illumina, Inc. {CA}, {USA}), called Infinium {HumanMethylation}450 (Infinium Methylation 450K; Illumina, Inc. {CA}, {USA}) was developed. This upgraded technology is a hybrid of two different chemical assays, the Infinium I and Infinium {II} assays, allowing (for 12 samples in parallel) assessment of the methylation status of more than 480,000 cytosines distributed over the whole genome. In this article, we evaluate Infinium Methylation 450K on cell lines and tissue samples, highlighting some of its advantages but also some of its limitations. In particular, we compare the methylation values of the Infinium I and Infinium {II} assays. Materials \& methods: We used Infinium Methylation 450K to profile: first, the well-characterized {HCT}116 wild-type and double-knockout cell lines and then, 16 breast tissue samples (including eight normal and eight primary tumor samples). Absolute methylation values (β-values) were extracted with the {GenomeStudio}™ software and then subjected to detailed analysis. Results: While this technology appeared highly robust as previously shown, we noticed a divergence between the β-values retrieved from the type I and type {II} Infinium assays. Specifically, the β-values obtained from Infinium {II} probes were less accurate and reproducible than those obtained from Infinium I probes. This suggests that data from the type I and type {II} assays should be considered separately in any downstream bioinformatic analysis. To be able to deal with the Infinium I and Infinium {II} data together, we developed and tested a new correction technique, which we called ‘peak-based correction’. The idea was to rescale the Infinium {II} data on the basis of the Infinium I data. While this technique should be viewed as an approximation method, it significantly improves the quality of Infinium {II} data. Conclusion: Infinium 450K is a powerful technique in terms of reagent costs, time of labor, sample throughput and coverage. It holds great promise for the better understanding of the epigenetic component in health and disease. Yet, due to the nature of its design comprising two different chemical assays, analysis of the whole set of data is not as easy as initially anticipated. Correction strategies, such as the peak-based approach proposed here, are a step towards adequate output data analysis.},

To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role, we surveyed 1,230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low ({\textless}15\%) and high (≥15\%) frequencies of {TERT} promoter mutations. The nine {TERT}-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal, including melanomas, liposarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, medulloblastomas, and subtypes of gliomas (including 83\% of primary glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor type). {TERT} and {ATRX} mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis, {TERT} mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
The prediction of clinical behavior, response to therapy, and outcome of infiltrative glioma is challenging. On the basis of previous studies of tumor biology, we defined five glioma molecular groups with the use of three alterations: mutations in the {TERT} promoter, mutations in {IDH}, and codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion). We tested the hypothesis that within groups based on these features, tumors would have similar clinical variables, acquired somatic alterations, and germline variants.

{METHODS}
We scored tumors as negative or positive for each of these markers in 1087 gliomas and compared acquired alterations and patient characteristics among the five primary molecular groups. Using 11,590 controls, we assessed associations between these groups and known glioma germline variants.

{RESULTS}
Among 615 grade {II} or {III} gliomas, 29\% had all three alterations (i.e., were triplepositive), 5\% had {TERT} and {IDH} mutations, 45\% had only {IDH} mutations, 7\% were triple-negative, and 10\% had only {TERT} mutations; 5\% had other combinations. Among 472 grade {IV} gliomas, less than 1\% were triple-positive, 2\% had {TERT} and {IDH} mutations, 7\% had only {IDH} mutations, 17\% were triple-negative, and 74\% had only {TERT} mutations. The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among patients who had gliomas with only {IDH} mutations and was highest (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only {TERT} mutations. The molecular groups were independently associated with overall survival among patients with grade {II} or {III} gliomas but not among patients with grade {IV} gliomas. The molecular groups were associated with specific germline variants.

{CONCLUSIONS}
Gliomas were classified into five principal groups on the basis of three tumor markers. The groups had different ages at onset, overall survival, and associations with germline variants, which implies that they are characterized by distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis.},

Understanding the degree to which these two mutations co-occur or occur exclusively of one another in glioma subtypes presents a unique opportunity to guide glioma classification and prognosis. We analyzed the relationship between overall survival ({OS}) and the presence of {IDH}1/2 and {TERT} promoter mutations in a panel of 473 adult gliomas. We hypothesized and show that genetic signatures capable of distinguishing among several types of gliomas could be established providing clinically relevant information that can serve as an adjunct to histopathological diagnosis. We found that mutations in the {TERT} promoter occurred in 74.2\% of glioblastomas ({GBM}), but occurred in a minority of Grade {II}-{III} astrocytomas (18.2\%). In contrast, {IDH}1/2 mutations were observed in 78.4\% of Grade {II}-{III} astrocytomas, but were uncommon in primary {GBM}. In oligodendrogliomas, {TERT} promoter and {IDH}1/2 mutations co-occurred in 79\% of cases. Patients whose Grade {III}-{IV} gliomas exhibit {TERT} promoter mutations alone predominately have primary {GBMs} associated with poor median {OS} (11.5 months). Patients whose Grade {III}-{IV} gliomas exhibit {IDH}1/2 mutations alone predominately have astrocytic morphologies and exhibit a median {OS} of 57 months while patients whose tumors exhibit both {TERT} promoter and {IDH}1/2 mutations predominately exhibit oligodendroglial morphologies and exhibit median {OS} of 125 months. Analyzing gliomas based on their genetic signatures allows for the stratification of these patients into distinct cohorts, with unique prognosis and survival.},

The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of {DNA} copy number, gene expression and {DNA} methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas—the most common type of adult brain cancer—and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of {ERBB}2, {NF}1 and {TP}53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-{OH} kinase regulatory subunit gene {PIK}3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, {DNA} methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between {MGMT} promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of {TCGA}, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.},

Between 1980 and 1994, 715 glioblastomas were diagnosed. The incidence rate per 100,000 population/year, adjusted to the World Standard Population, was 3.32 in males and 2.24 in females. Observed survival rates were 42.4\% at 6 months, 17.7\% at 1 year, and 3.3\% at 2 years. For all of the age groups, younger patients survived significantly longer, ranging from a median of 8.8 months ({\textless}50 years) to 1.6 months ({\textgreater}80 years). Loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) 10q was the most frequent genetic alteration (69\%), followed by {EGFR} amplification (34\%), {TP}53 mutations (31\%), p16INK4a deletion (31\%), and {PTEN} mutations (24\%). {LOH} 10q occurred in association with any of the other genetic alterations and was predictive of shorter survival. Primary (de novo) glioblastomas prevailed (95\%), whereas secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic gliomas were rare (5\%). Secondary glioblastomas were characterized by frequent {LOH} 10q (63\%) and {TP}53 mutations (65\%). Of the {TP}53 mutations in secondary glioblastomas, 57\% were in hotspot codons 248 and 273, whereas in primary glioblastomas, mutations were more equally distributed. G:C→A:T mutations at {CpG} sites were more frequent in secondary than primary glioblastomas (56\% versus 30\%; P = 0.0208). This suggests that the acquisition of {TP}53 mutations in these glioblastoma subtypes occurs through different mechanisms.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
Amplification and activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) oncogene are molecular hallmarks of glioblastomas. We hypothesized that deletion of {NFKBIA} (encoding nuclear factor of κ-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-α), an inhibitor of the {EGFR}-signaling pathway, promotes tumorigenesis in glioblastomas that do not have alterations of {EGFR}.

{METHODS}
We analyzed 790 human glioblastomas for deletions, mutations, or expression of {NFKBIA} and {EGFR}. We studied the tumor-suppressor activity of {NFKBIA} in tumor-cell culture. We compared the molecular results with the outcome of glioblastoma in 570 affected persons.

{RESULTS}
{NFKBIA} is often deleted but not mutated in glioblastomas; most deletions occur in nonclassical subtypes of the disease. Deletion of {NFKBIA} and amplification of {EGFR} show a pattern of mutual exclusivity. Restoration of the expression of {NFKBIA} attenuated the malignant phenotype and increased the vulnerability to chemotherapy of cells cultured from tumors with {NFKBIA} deletion; it also reduced the viability of cells with {EGFR} amplification but not of cells with normal gene dosages of both {NFKBIA} and {EGFR}. Deletion and low expression of {NFKBIA} were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients who had tumors with {NFKBIA} deletion had outcomes that were similar to those in patients with tumors harboring {EGFR} amplification. These outcomes were poor as compared with the outcomes in patients with tumors that had normal gene dosages of {NFKBIA} and {EGFR}. A two-gene model that was based on expression of {NFKBIA} and O-methylguanine {DNA} methyltransferase was strongly associated with the clinical course of the disease.

{CONCLUSIONS}
Deletion of {NFKBIA} has an effect that is similar to the effect of {EGFR} amplification in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma and is associated with comparatively short survival.},

Quantitative real-time {PCR} showed {PIK}3CA amplification ({\textgreater}3 copy numbers) in 14/107 (13\%) primary and 3/32 (9\%) secondary glioblastomas.

Taken together with previously published data on {EGFR} amplification and {PTEN} mutations, at least one alteration in the {EGFR}, {PTEN}, or {PIK}3CA genes was detected in 63\% of primary glioblastomas, which was significantly more frequent than in secondary glioblastomas (31\%; P {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, this signaling pathway was altered by either {PTEN} mutations or {PIK}3CA amplification in 10 of 12 (83\%) malignant glioma cell lines analyzed.

There was a significant association between {MDM}2 {SNP}309 G alleles and {TP}53 codon 72 Pro/Pro in glioblastomas. Glioblastoma patients with {TP}53 codon 72 Pro/Pro genotype were significantly younger than Arg/Arg carriers (mean 50.2 vs. 56.1 years; P = 0.018).

	abstract = {Purpose: To establish the frequency of {IDH}1 mutations in glioblastomas at a population level, and to assess whether they allow reliable discrimination between primary (de novo) glioblastomas and secondary glioblastomas that progressed from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma.
Experimental Design: We screened glioblastomas from a population-based study for {IDH}1 mutations and correlated them with clinical data and other genetic alterations.
Results:{IDH}1 mutations were detected in 36 of 407 glioblastomas (8.8\%). Glioblastoma patients with {IDH}1 mutations were younger (mean, 47.9 years) than those with {EGFR} amplification (60.9 years) and were associated with significantly longer survival (mean, 27.1 versus 11.3 months; P {\textless} 0.0001). {IDH}1 mutations were frequent in glioblastomas diagnosed as secondary (22 of 30; 73\%), but rare in primary glioblastomas (14 of 377; 3.7\%: P {\textless} 0.0001). {IDH}1 mutations as genetic marker of secondary glioblastoma corresponded to the respective clinical diagnosis in 95\% of cases. Glioblastomas with {IDH}1 mutation diagnosed as primary had clinical and genetic profiles similar to those of secondary glioblastomas, suggesting that they may have rapidly progressed from a less malignant precursor lesion that escaped clinical diagnosis and were thus misclassified as primary. Conversely, glioblastomas without {IDH}1 mutations clinically diagnosed as secondary typically developed from anaplastic rather than low-grade gliomas, suggesting that at least some were actually primary glioblastomas, that may have been misclassified, possibly due to histologic sampling error.
Conclusion:{IDH}1 mutations are a strong predictor of a more favorable prognosis and a highly selective molecular marker of secondary glioblastomas that complements clinical criteria for distinguishing them from primary glioblastomas. (Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(19):6002–7)},

	abstract = {We have previously shown that the {EphA}2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) and represents a novel, attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of brain tumors. Here, we have developed an {EphA}2-targeted agent, {ephrinA}1-{PE}38QQR, a novel cytotoxin composed of {ephrinA}1, a ligand for {EphA}2, and {PE}38QQR, a mutated form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. {EphrinA}1-{PE}38QQR showed potent and dose-dependent killing of {GBM} cells overexpressing the {EphA}2 receptor in cell viability and clonogenic survival assays, with an average {IC}(50) of approximately 10(-11) mol/L. The conjugate was also highly effective in killing breast and prostate cancer cells overexpressing {EphA}2. The cytotoxic effect of {ephrinA}1-{PE}38QQR was specific, as it was neutralized by an excess of {EphA}2 ligands. Moreover, normal human endothelial cells and breast cancer cells that do not overexpress {EphA}2, as well as {GBM} cells that have down-regulated {EphA}2, were not susceptible to the cytotoxin. {EphrinA}1-{PE}38QQR-mediated cytotoxicity induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was, however, not responsible for cell death in response to the conjugate. In addition, the conjugate elicited no changes in the activity of survival pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase, measured by {AKT} phosphorylation. This is the first attempt to create a cytotoxic therapy using any of the ephrin ligands of either class (A or B) conjugated to a bacterial toxin. {EphrinA}1-{PE}38QQR is very potent and specific, produces cell death that is caspase independent, and forms the basis for the further development of clinically applicable {EphA}2-targeted cytotoxins.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Epigenetic silencing of the {MGMT} (O6-methylguanine-{DNA} methyltransferase) {DNA}-repair gene by promoter methylation compromises {DNA} repair and has been associated with longer survival in patients with glioblastoma who receive alkylating agents.
{METHODS}: We tested the relationship between {MGMT} silencing in the tumor and the survival of patients who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant treatment with temozolomide. The methylation status of the {MGMT} promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction analysis.
{RESULTS}: The {MGMT} promoter was methylated in 45 percent of 206 assessable cases. Irrespective of treatment, {MGMT} promoter methylation was an independent favorable prognostic factor (P{\textless}0.001 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.61). Among patients whose tumor contained a methylated {MGMT} promoter, a survival benefit was observed in patients treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy; their median survival was 21.7 months (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 30.4), as compared with 15.3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 13.0 to 20.9) among those who were assigned to only radiotherapy (P=0.007 by the log-rank test). In the absence of methylation of the {MGMT} promoter, there was a smaller and statistically insignificant difference in survival between the treatment groups.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated {MGMT} promoter benefited from temozolomide, whereas those who did not have a methylated {MGMT} promoter did not have such a benefit.},

However, reports on the correlation between {MGMT} and clinical outcomes in Chinese glioblastoma patients are very scarce. In this study, quantitative methylation data were obtained by the pyrosequencing of tumor tissues from 128 {GBM} patients. The median overall survival ({OS}) was 13.1 months, with a 1-year survival of 45.3\%. The pyrosequencing data were reproducible based on archived samples yielding data for all glioblastomas. {MGMT} promoter methylation was detected in 75/128 cases (58.6\%), whereas 53/128 (41.4\%) cases were unmethylated. Further survival analysis also revealed that methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with prolonged {OS} but not with progression-free survival ({PFS}) (p = 0.029 and p = 0.112, respectively); the hazard radios were 0.63 (95\% {CI}: 0.42-0.96) and 0.72 (95\% {CI}: 0.48-1.09), respectively.

	abstract = {Glioblastoma ({GBM}) is the most lethal type of human brain cancer, where deletions and mutations in the tumour suppressor gene {PTEN} (phosphatase and tensin homolog) are frequent events and are associated with therapeutic resistance. Herein, we report a novel chromatin-associated function of {PTEN} in complex with the histone chaperone {DAXX} and the histone variant H3.3. We show that {PTEN} interacts with {DAXX} and, in turn {PTEN} directly regulates oncogene expression by modulating {DAXX}-H3.3 association on the chromatin, independently of {PTEN} enzymatic activity. Furthermore, {DAXX} inhibition specifically suppresses tumour growth and improves the survival of orthotopically engrafted mice implanted with human {PTEN}-deficient glioma samples, associated with global H3.3 genomic distribution changes leading to upregulation of tumour suppressor genes and downregulation of oncogenes. Moreover, {DAXX} expression anti-correlates with {PTEN} expression in {GBM} patient samples. Since loss of chromosome 10 and {PTEN} are common events in cancer, this synthetic growth defect mediated by {DAXX} suppression represents a therapeutic opportunity to inhibit tumorigenesis specifically in the context of {PTEN} deletion.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma ({GBM}) is a highly lethal brain tumour presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary {GBM} subtype presents acutely as a high-grade disease that typically harbours mutations in {EGFR}, {PTEN} and {INK}4A/{ARF} (also known as {CDKN}2A), and the secondary {GBM} subtype evolves from the slow progression of a low-grade disease that classically possesses {PDGF} and {TP}53 events. Here we show that concomitant central nervous system ({CNS})-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse {CNS} generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with notable clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary {GBM} in humans. This genetic observation prompted {TP}53 and {PTEN} mutational analysis in human primary {GBM}, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of {TP}53 as well as the expected {PTEN} mutations. Integrated transcriptomic profiling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells ({NSCs}) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives increased Myc protein levels and its associated signature. Functional studies validated increased Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of {NSCs} doubly null for p53 and Pten (p53(-/-) Pten(-/-)) as well as tumour neurospheres ({TNSs}) derived from this model. Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53(-/-) Pten(-/-) {TNSs}. These murine modelling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary {GBM}, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumour suppressor mutation profile in human primary {GBM} and establish Myc as an important target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential.},

Recent research supports the molecular classification of gliomas based on genetic alterations or gene expression profiles, and imaging data supports the concept that molecular subtypes of glioma may be distinguished through non-invasive anatomical, physiological and metabolic imaging techniques, suggesting differences in the baseline biology of genetic subtypes of infiltrating glioma. Furthermore, {MRI} signatures are now being associated with complex gene expression profiles and cellular signalling pathways through genome-wide microarray studies using samples obtained by image guidance which may be co-registered with clinical imaging. In this review we describe the pathobiology, molecular pathogenesis, stem cells and imaging characteristics of gliomas with emphasis on astrocytomas and oligodendroglial neoplasms.},

	abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases ({PI}3K) are a family of enzymes that relay important cellular growth control signals. Recently, a large-scale mutational analysis of eight {PI}3K and eight {PI}3K-like genes revealed somatic mutations in {PIK}3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of class {IA} {PI}3K, in several types of cancer, including glioblastoma multiforme. In that report, 4 of 15 (27\%) glioblastomas contained potentially oncogenic {PIK}3CA mutations. Subsequent studies, however, showed a significantly lower mutation rate ranging from 0\% to 7\%. Given this disparity and to address the relation of patient age to mutation frequency, we examined 10 exons of {PIK}3CA in 73 glioblastoma samples by {PCR} amplification followed by direct {DNA} sequencing. Overall, {PIK}3CA mutations were found in 11 (15\%) samples, including several novel mutations. {PIK}3CA mutations were distributed in all sample types, with 18\%, 9\%, and 13\% of primary tumors, xenografts, and cell lines containing mutations, respectively. Of the primary tumors, {PIK}3CA mutations were identified in 21\% and 17\% of pediatric and adult samples, respectively. No evidence of {PIK}3CA gene amplification was detected by quantitative real-time {PCR} in any of the samples. This study confirms that {PIK}3CA mutations occur in a significant number of human glioblastomas, further indicating that therapeutic targeting of this pathway in glioblastomas is of value. Moreover, this is the first study showing {PIK}3CA mutations in pediatric glioblastomas, thus providing a molecular target in this important pediatric malignancy. (Mol Cancer Res 2006;4(10):709–14)},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary tumor in the central nervous system. One of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs for {GBM} is temozolomide, which is a {DNA}-alkylating agent and its efficacy is dependent on {MGMT} methylation status. Little progress in improving the prognosis of {GBM} patients has been made in the past ten years, urging the development of more effective molecular targeted therapies. Hyper-activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ({PI}3K)/Akt pathway is frequently found in a variety of cancers including {GBM}, and it plays a central role in the regulation of tumor cell survival, growth, motility, angiogenesis and metabolism. Numerous {PI}3K inhibitors including pan-{PI}3K, isoform-selective and dual {PI}3K/mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) inhibitors have exhibited favorable preclinical results and entered clinical trials in a range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Furthermore, combination of inhibitors targeting {PI}3K and other related pathways may exert synergism on suppressing tumor growth and improving patients' prognosis. Currently, only a handful of {PI}3K inhibitors are in phase I/{II} clinical trials for {GBM} treatment. In this review, we focus on the importance of {PI}3K/Akt pathway in {GBM}, and summarize the current development of {PI}3K inhibitors alone or in combination with other inhibitors for {GBM} treatment from preclinical to clinical studies.},

We hypothesize that alterations of {PDGFRA} will promote distinct prognostic and treatment implications in pediatric {HGG}. In order to characterize the impact of {PDGFR} pathway alterations, we integrated genomic data from pediatric {HGG} patients (n=290) from multiple pediatric datasets and sequencing platforms. Integration of multiple human datasets showed that {PDGFRA} mutation, but not amplification, was associated with older age in pediatric {HGG} (P= {\textless}0.0001). In multivariate analysis, {PDGFRA} mutation was correlated with worse prognosis (P = 0.026), while {PDGFRA} amplification was not (P = 0.11). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, non-brainstem {HGG} with {PDGFRA} amplification carried a worse prognosis than non-brainstem {HGG} without {PDGFRA} amplification (P = 0.021). There were no pediatric patients with {PDGFRA}-amplified {HGG} that survived longer than two years. Additionally, we performed paired molecular profiling (germline / tumor / primary cell culture) and targeting of an infant thalamic {HGG} with amplification and outlier increased expression of {PDGFRA}. Dasatinib inhibited proliferation most effectively. In summary, integration of the largest genomic dataset of pediatric {HGG} to date, allowed us to highlight that {PDGFRA} mutation is found in older pediatric patients and that {PDGFRA} amplification is prognostic in non-brainstem {HGG}. Future precision-medicine based clinical trials for pediatric patients with {PDGFRA}-altered {HGG} should consider the optimized delivery of dasatinib.},

Platelet-derived Growth Factor ({PDGF}) genes have been enrolled as drivers of this tumour progression as well as potential therapeutic targets. As detailed understanding of the expression pattern of {PDGF} system in the context of {GBM} intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity is lacking in the literature, this study aims at characterising {PDGF} expression in different histologically-defined {GBM} regions as well as investigating correlation of these genes expression with parameters related to poor prognosis. Z-score normalised expression values of {PDGF} subunits from multiple slices of 36 {GBMs}, alongside with clinical and genomic data on those {GBMs} patients, were compiled from Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project – Allen Institute for Brain Science data sets. {PDGF} subunits show differential expression over distinct regions of {GBM} and {PDGF} family is heterogeneously expressed among different brain lobes affected by {GBM}. Further, {PDGF} family expression correlates with bad prognosis factors: age at {GBM} diagnosis, Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog deletion and Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 mutation. These findings may aid on clinical management of {GBM} and development of targeted curative therapies against this devastating tumour.},

This study aimed to investigate their impact on temozolomide chemosensitivity and relationship with O(6)-methylguanine {DNA} methyltransferase ({MGMT}) promoter methylation in secondary glioblastoma. Searches for {IDH}1 and {IDH}2 mutations, 1p19q codeletion, {MGMT} promoter methylation, and p53 expression were carried out in a series of 86 secondary glioblastomas and correlated with progression-free survival and overall survival. Response to temozolomide was evaluated by progression-free survival, as well as by tumor size on successive {MRI} scans, then correlated with molecular alterations. {IDH} ({IDH}1 or {IDH}2) mutations were found in 58/79 patients (73.4\%). {IDH} mutation, {MGMT} promoter methylation, and 1p19q codeletion were associated with prolonged progression-free survival in univariate (P {\textless} 0.001, P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.003, respectively) and multivariate analysis (P {\textless} 0.001, P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.035, respectively). {IDH} mutation (P = 0.001) and {MGMT} promoter methylation (P = 0.011) were correlated with a higher rate of objective response to temozolomide. Further analysis of response to temozolomide showed that patients with both {IDH} mutation and {MGMT} promoter methylation had the best response rate to temozolomide. {IDH} mutation appears to be a significant marker of positive chemosensitivity in secondary glioblastoma. Use of {IDH} status combined with {MGMT} promoter status as a stratification factor seems appropriate in future clinical trials involving temozolomide for the treatment of patients with secondary glioblastoma.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: p53 pathway alterations are key molecular events in glioblastoma ({GBM}). {MDM}2 inhibitors increase expression and stability of p53 and are presumed to be most efficacious in patients with {TP}53 wild-type and {MDM}2-amplified cancers. However, this biomarker hypothesis has not been tested in patients or patient-derived models for {GBM}.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We performed a preclinical evaluation of {RG}7112 {MDM}2 inhibitor, across a panel of 36 patient-derived {GBM} cell lines ({PDCL}), each genetically characterized according to their P53 pathway status. We then performed a pharmacokinetic ({PK}) profiling of {RG}7112 distribution in mice and evaluated the therapeutic activity of {RG}7112 in orthotopic and subcutaneous {GBM} models.
{RESULTS}: {MDM}2-amplified {PDCLs} were 44 times more sensitive than {TP}53-mutated lines that showed complete resistance at therapeutically attainable concentrations (avg. {IC}50 of 0.52 μmol/L vs. 21.9 μmol/L). {MDM}4-amplified {PDCLs} were highly sensitive but showed intermediate response (avg. {IC}50 of 1.2 μmol/L), whereas response was heterogeneous in {TP}53 wild-type {PDCLs} with normal {MDM}2/4 levels (avg. {IC}50 of 7.7 μmol/L). In {MDM}2-amplified lines, {RG}7112 restored p53 activity inducing robust p21 expression and apoptosis. {PK} profiling of {RG}7112-treated {PDCL} intracranial xenografts demonstrated that the compound significantly crosses the blood-brain and the blood-tumor barriers. Most importantly, treatment of {MDM}2-amplified/{TP}53 wild-type {PDCL}-derived model (subcutaneous and orthotopic) reduced tumor growth, was cytotoxic, and significantly increased survival.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data strongly support development of {MDM}2 inhibitors for clinical testing in {MDM}2-amplified {GBM} patients. Moreover, significant efficacy in a subset of non-{MDM}2-amplified models suggests that additional markers of response to {MDM}2 inhibitors must be identified.},

At present, a number of inhibitors, both antibodies against {MET} or its ligand hepatocyte growth factor, and small molecule {MET} tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in clinical trials. We here describe a novel variant of {MET} that is expressed in 6\% of high-grade gliomas. Characterization of this mutation in a glioma cell line revealed that it consists of an intronic deletion, resulting in a splice event connecting an intact splice donor site in exon 6 with the next splice acceptor site being that of exon 9. The encoded protein lacks parts of the extracellular {IPT} domains 1 and 2, encoded by exons 7 and 8, resulting in a novel pseudo-{IPT} and is named {MET}(Δ7-8). {MET}(Δ7-8) is located predominantly in the cytosol and is constitutively active. The auto-activating nature of {MET}(Δ7-8), in combination with a lack of transmembrane localization, renders {MET}(Δ7-8) not targetable using antibodies, although the protein is efficiently deactivated by {MET}-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Testing of {MET}-expressing tumors for the presence of this variant may be important for treatment decision making.},

Multivariate analysis revealed that c-Met(high) expression was an independent predictor of poor overall and disease-free survival in patients with {IHCC}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: c-Met overexpression is associated with {EGFR} expression and is a poor prognostic factor in {CC}.},

	abstract = {The multifunctional growth factor scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor ({SF}/{HGF}) and its receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met have emerged as key determinants of brain tumor growth and angiogenesis. {SF}/{HGF} and c-Met are expressed in brain tumors, the expression levels frequently correlating with tumor grade, tumor blood vessel density, and poor prognosis. Overexpression of {SF}/{HGF} and/or c-Met in brain tumor cells enhances their tumorigenicity, tumor growth, and tumor-associated angiogenesis. Conversely, inhibition of {SF}/{HGF} and c-Met in experimental tumor xenografts leads to inhibition of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. {SF}/{HGF} is expressed and secreted mainly by tumor cells and acts on c-Met receptors that are expressed in tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells. Activation of c-Met leads to induction of proliferation, migration, and invasion and to inhibition of apoptosis in tumor cells as well as in tumor vascular endothelial cells. Activation of tumor endothelial c-Met also induces extracellular matrix degradation, tubule formation, and angiogenesis in vivo. {SF}/{HGF} induces brain tumor angiogenesis directly through only partly known mechanisms and indirectly by regulating other angiogenic pathways such as {VEGF}. Different approaches to inhibiting {SF}/{HGF} and c-Met have been recently developed. These include receptor antagonism with {SF}/{HGF} fragments such as {NK}4, {SF}/{HGF}, and c-Met expression inhibition with U1snRNA/ribozymes; competitive ligand binding with soluble Met receptors; neutralizing antibodies to {SF}/{HGF}; and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Use of these inhibitors in experimental tumor models leads to inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of how the {SF}/{HGF}:c-Met pathway contributes to brain tumor malignancy with a focus on glioma angiogenesis.},

	abstract = {We have recently shown that vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) is produced by human malignant glioma cells and acts on tumor endothelial cells, which express {VEGF} receptors, suggesting that {VEGF} is a regulator of tumor angiogenesis. To investigate the feasibility of antiangiogenic brain tumor therapy, we developed an intracerebral (i.c.) rat glioma model. We used two transplantable rat glioma cells lines, C6 and {GS}-9L, to analyze {VEGF} regulation in vitro and expression of {VEGF} and its high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, flt-1 and flk-1, in vivo. Glioma cells were transplanted i.c. or s.c. into syngeneic rats. C6 gliomas exhibit morphological characteristics of human glioblastoma multiforme such as necroses with palisading cells. Immunocytochemistry with von Willebrand factor showed that C6 gliomas are highly vascularized and therefore show another prominent feature of human glioblastoma. {GS}-9L gliosarcomas were less vascularized. In situ hybridization showed that {VEGF} is expressed in vivo in rat glioma cells which reside along necrotic areas and therefore closely mimicks the expression pattern of {VEGF} observed in human glioblastoma. flt-1 and flk-1 are specifically expressed in endothelial cells in the tumor and at the border between tumor and normal brain but are absent from endothelial cells in the normal brain proper. The action of {VEGF} may therefore be restricted to tumor endothelium. Upregulation of {VEGF}, but not acid fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor B messenger {RNA} was observed in hypoxic C6 and {GS}-9L cells in vitro. These observations are consistent with a role for {VEGF} in tumor- and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Since the expression pattern of {VEGF} and its receptors in rat glioma appears to be indistinguishable from human glioblastoma multiforme, this model provides an excellent tool to study anti-angiogenic therapy.},

{METHOD}: The presence of {VEGF} and {MMP}-9 proteins in paraffin-embedded tumour specimens from patients with glioma was detected using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between the levels of {VEGF} and {MMP}-9 proteins and tumour grade was analysed.
{RESULTS}: A total of 32 patients with low-grade gliomas (World Health Organization [{WHO}] grade {II}) and 48 patients with high-grade gliomas ({WHO} grades {III}-{IV}) participated in the study. Positive immunohistochemical staining of {VEGF} and {MMP}-9 proteins was detected in 58/80 (72.5\%) and 60/80 (75.0\%) of patients, respectively. The level of {VEGF} immunostaining was significantly positively correlated with the level of {MMP}-9 immunostaining (r = 0.78). Significantly more high-grade gliomas (grades {III}-{IV}) demonstrated positive {VEGF} and {MMP}-9 immunostaining compared with the low grade gliomas (grades I-{II}).

To identify the genetic alterations in {GBMs}, we sequenced 20,661 protein coding genes, determined the presence of amplifications and deletions using high-density oligonucleotide arrays, and performed gene expression analyses using next-generation sequencing technologies in 22 human tumor samples. This comprehensive analysis led to the discovery of a variety of genes that were not known to be altered in {GBMs}. Most notably, we found recurrent mutations in the active site of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ({IDH}1) in 12\% of {GBM} patients. Mutations in {IDH}1 occurred in a large fraction of young patients and in most patients with secondary {GBMs} and were associated with an increase in overall survival. These studies demonstrate the value of unbiased genomic analyses in the characterization of human brain cancer and identify a potentially useful genetic alteration for the classification and targeted therapy of {GBMs}.
Comprehensive analysis of mutations in a brain cancer identifies previously unidentified cancer genes and a frequently mutated protein that may serve as a therapeutic marker.

Thus, {MDM}2 represents the second most frequently amplified gene after the epidermal growth factor receptor gene in these tumor types. Sequencing of the p53 transcripts in the cases with {MDM}2 amplification revealed no mutations and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed, with one exception, no losses of alleles on chromosome 17. Our results indicate that amplification and overexpression of {MDM}2 may be an alternative molecular mechanism by which a subset of human malignant gliomas escapes from p53-regulated growth control.},

This information is generally presented using a mathematical tree – a structure used to describe the evolutionary history of the taxa at a high level. These trees come in several different varieties and can be inferred in several different ways. There is a great amount of effort being put into methods of estimating trees, as well as determining particular phylogenies for species of interest.},

All the therapies that have demonstrated a significant survival benefit for gliomas in Phase {III} trials, including radiation, chemotherapy (temozolomide and {PCV} [procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine]), and tumor-treating fields, are based on nonspecific targeting of proliferating cells. Recent advances in the molecular understanding of gliomas suggest some potential reasons for the failure of more targeted therapies in gliomas. Specifically, the histologic-based glioma classification is composed of multiple different molecular subtypes with distinct biology, natural history, and prognosis. As a result of these insights, the diagnosis and classification of gliomas have recently been updated by the World Health Organization. However, these changes and other novel observations regarding glioma biomarkers and subtypes highlight several clinical challenges. First, the field is faced with the difficulty of reinterpreting the results of prior studies and retrospective data using the new classifications to clarify prognostic assessments and treatment recommendations for patients. Second, the new classifications and insights require rethinking the design and stratification of future clinical trials. Last, these observations provide the essential framework for the development and testing of new specific targeted therapies for particular glioma subtypes. This review aims to summarize the current literature regarding glioma subclassifications and their clinical relevance in this evolving field.},

Chromosomal locations of genes distinguishing tumor subclass parallel {DNA} copy number differences between subclasses.

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-{SNE} is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-{SNE} can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-{SNE} on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-{SNE} are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is one of the hallmarks of human cancers. Tumor genotype variations among tumors within different patients are known as interpatient heterogeneity, and variability among multiple tumors of the same type arising in the same patient is referred to as intra-patient heterogeneity. Subpopulations of cancer cells with distinct phenotypic and molecular features within a tumor are called intratumor heterogeneity ({ITH}). Since Nowell proposed the clonal evolution of tumor cell populations in 1976, tumor heterogeneity, especially {ITH}, was actively studied. Research has focused on the genetic basis of cancer, particularly mutational activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes ({TSGs}). The phenomenon of {ITH} is commonly explained by Darwinian-like clonal evolution of a single tumor. Despite the monoclonal origin of most cancers, new clones arise during tumor progression due to the continuous acquisition of mutations. It is clear that disruption of the "epigenetic machinery" plays an important role in cancer development. Aberrant epigenetic changes occur more frequently than gene mutations in human cancers. The epigenome is at the intersection of the environment and genome. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs in the earliest stage of cancer. The current trend of epigenetic therapy is to use epigenetic drugs to reverse and/or delay future resistance to cancer therapies. A majority of cancer therapies fail to achieve durable responses, which is often attributed to {ITH}. Epigenetic therapy may reverse drug resistance in heterogeneous cancer. Complete understanding of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity may assist in designing combinations of targeted therapies based on molecular information extracted from individual tumors.},

Promoter methylation status of the {DNA} repair enzyme O6-methylguanine {DNA} methyltransferase ({MGMT}) is the most important clinical biomarker in glioblastoma, predicting for therapeutic response. However, it does not always correlate with response. This may be due to intratumoral heterogeneity, with a single biopsy unlikely to represent the entire lesion. Aberrations in other {DNA} repair mechanisms may also contribute. This study investigated intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple glioblastoma tumors with a particular focus on the {DNA} repair pathways. Transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 40\% of cases with variability in {MGMT} methylation status found in 14\% of cases. As well as identifying intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, targeted next generation sequencing identified between 1 and 37 unique sequence variants per specimen. In-silico tools were then able to identify deleterious variants in both the base excision repair and the mismatch repair pathways that may contribute to therapeutic response. As these pathways have roles in temozolomide response, these findings may confound patient management and highlight the importance of assessing multiple tumor biopsies.},

Therefore, analysis of fold changes is the standard method, but often, a doubly differential analysis of changes of changes is required. Differential alternative splicing is an example of a doubly differential analysis, i.e. fold changes between conditions for different isoforms of a gene. {EmpiRe} is a quantitative approach for various kinds of omics data based on fold changes for appropriate features of biological objects. Empirical error distributions for these fold changes are estimated from Replicate measurements and used to quantify feature fold changes and their directions. We assess the performance of {EmpiRe} to detect differentially expressed genes applied to {RNA}-Seq using simulated data. It achieved higher precision than established tools at nearly the same recall level. Furthermore, we assess the detection of alternatively Spliced genes via changes of isoform fold changes ({EmpiReS}) on distribution-free simulations and experimentally validated splicing events. {EmpiReS} achieves the best precision-recall values for simulations based on different biological datasets. We propose {EmpiRe}(S) as a general, quantitative and fast approach with high reliability and an excellent trade-off between sensitivity and precision in (doubly) differential analyses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we describe the assembly of a ‘splicing code’, which uses combinations of hundreds of {RNA} features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger {RNA} decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale.},

	title = {A General Definition and Nomenclature for Alternative Splicing Events},
	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the transcriptome present in eukaryotic cells is one of the most challenging tasks in the postgenomic era. In this regard, alternative splicing ({AS}) is a key phenomenon contributing to the production of different mature transcripts from the same primary {RNA} sequence. As a plethora of different transcript forms is available in databases, a first step to uncover the biology that drives {AS} is to identify the different types of reflected splicing variation. In this work, we present a general definition of the {AS} event along with a notation system that involves the relative positions of the splice sites. This nomenclature univocally and dynamically assigns a specific ‘‘{AS} code’’ to every possible pattern of splicing variation. On the basis of this definition and the corresponding codes, we have developed a computational tool ({AStalavista}) that automatically characterizes the complete landscape of {AS} events in a given transcript annotation of a genome, thus providing a platform to investigate the transcriptome diversity across genes, chromosomes, and species. Our analysis reveals that a substantial part—in human more than a quarter—of the observed splicing variations are ignored in common classification pipelines. We have used {AStalavista} to investigate and to compare the {AS} landscape of different reference annotation sets in human and in other metazoan species and found that proportions of {AS} events change substantially depending on the annotation protocol, species-specific attributes, and coding constraints acting on the transcripts. The {AStalavista} system therefore provides a general framework to conduct specific studies investigating the occurrence, impact, and regulation of {AS}.},

	abstract = {Many methods for transcript-level abundance estimation reduce the computational burden associated with the iterative algorithms they use by adopting an approximate factorization of the likelihood function they optimize. This leads to considerably faster convergence of the optimization procedure, since each round of e.g. the {EM} algorithm, can execute much more quickly. However, these approximate factorizations of the likelihood function simplify calculations at the expense of discarding certain information that can be useful for accurate transcript abundance estimation.We demonstrate that model simplifications (i.e. factorizations of the likelihood function) adopted by certain abundance estimation methods can lead to a diminished ability to accurately estimate the abundances of highly related transcripts. In particular, considering factorizations based on transcript-fragment compatibility alone can result in a loss of accuracy compared to the per-fragment, unsimplified model. However, we show that such shortcomings are not an inherent limitation of approximately factorizing the underlying likelihood function. By considering the appropriate conditional fragment probabilities, and adopting improved, data-driven factorizations of this likelihood, we demonstrate that such approaches can achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from methods that consider the complete (i.e. per-fragment) likelihood, while retaining the computational efficiently of the compatibility-based factorizations.Our data-driven factorizations are incorporated into a branch of the Salmon transcript quantification tool: https://github.com/{COMBINE}-lab/salmon/tree/factorizations.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Background: {RNA} sequencing has enabled high-throughput and fine-grained quantitative analyses of the transcriptome. While differential gene expression is the most widely used application of this technology, {RNA}-seq data also has the resolution to infer differential transcript usage ({DTU}), which can elucidate the role of different transcript isoforms between experimental conditions, cell types or tissues. {DTU} has typically been inferred from exon-count data, which has issues with assigning reads unambiguously to counting bins, and requires alignment of reads to the genome. Recently, approaches have emerged that use transcript quantification estimates directly for {DTU}. Transcript counts can be inferred from 'pseudo' or lightweight aligners, which are significantly faster than traditional genome alignment. However, recent evaluations show lower sensitivity in {DTU} analysis compared to exon-level analysis. Transcript abundances are estimated from equivalence classes ({ECs}), which determine the transcripts that any given read is compatible with. Recent work has proposed performing a variety of {RNA}-seq analysis directly on equivalence class counts ({ECCs})., 
Methods: Here we demonstrate that {ECCs} can be used effectively with existing count-based methods for detecting {DTU}. We evaluate this approach on simulated human and drosophila data, as well as on a real dataset through subset testing., 
Results: We find that {ECCs} have similar sensitivity and false discovery rates as exon-level counts but can be generated in a fraction of the time through the use of pseudo-aligners., 
Conclusions: We posit that equivalence class read counts are a natural unit on which to perform differential transcript usage analysis.},

To date, a number of computational approaches have been developed to identify and quantify differentially spliced genes from {RNA}-seq data, but a comprehensive intercomparison and appraisal of these approaches is currently lacking. In this study, we systematically evaluated 10 {DS} analysis tools for consistency and reproducibility, precision, recall and false discovery rate, agreement upon reported differentially spliced genes and functional enrichment. The tools were selected to represent the three different methodological categories: exon-based ({DEXSeq}, {edgeR}, {JunctionSeq}, limma), isoform-based (cuffdiff2, {DiffSplice}) and event-based methods ({dSpliceType}, {MAJIQ}, {rMATS}, {SUPPA}). Overall, all the exon-based methods and two event-based methods ({MAJIQ} and {rMATS}) scored well on the selected measures. Of the 10 tools tested, the exon-based methods performed generally better than the isoform-based and event-based methods. However, overall, the different data analysis tools performed strikingly differently across different data sets or numbers of samples.},

Yet, the pathophysiological processes involved in {AD} onset and progression are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain could contribute for a better understanding of the {AD} pathology. In this work, we probed the differential expression of genes in different brain regions of healthy and {AD} adult subjects using data from three large transcriptomic studies: Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Brain Bank ({MSBB}), and {ROSMAP}. Using a combination of differential expression of gene and isoform switch analyses, we provide a detailed landscape of gene expression alterations in the temporal and frontal lobes, harboring brain areas affected at early and late stages of the {AD} pathology, respectively. Next, we took advantage of an indirect approach to assign the complex gene expression changes revealed in bulk {RNAseq} to individual cell types/subtypes of the adult brain. This strategy allowed us to identify previously overlooked gene expression changes in the brain of {AD} patients. Among these alterations, we show isoform switches in the {AD} causal gene amyloid-beta precursor protein ({APP}) and the risk gene bridging integrator 1 ({BIN}1), which could have important functional consequences in neuronal cells. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze {RNAseq} data in {AD} and other neurodegenerative diseases based on both gene/transcript expression and regional/cell-type specificities.},

	abstract = {Tissue- and cell-type-specific regulators of alternative splicing ({AS}) are essential components of posttranscriptional gene regulation, necessary for normal cellular function, patterning, and development. Mice with ablation of Epithelial splicing regulatory protein (Esrp1) develop cleft lip and palate. Loss of both Esrp1 and its paralog Esrp2 results in widespread developmental defects with broad implications to human disease. Deletion of the Esrps in the epidermis revealed their requirement for establishing a proper skin barrier, a primary function of epithelial cells comprising the epidermis. We profiled the global Esrp-mediated splicing regulatory program in epidermis, which revealed large-scale programs of epithelial cell-type-specific splicing required for epithelial cell functions. These mice represent a valuable model for evaluating the essential role for {AS} in development and function of epithelial cells, which play essential roles in tissue homeostasis in numerous organs, and provide a genetic tool to evaluate important functional properties of epithelial-specific splice variants in vivo.
          , 
            Genes are turned into their protein products via two steps. The first, transcription, produces an intermediate {RNA} molecule or ‘transcript’; the second step, translation, turns the transcript into a protein. Most genes in mammals contain stretches of {DNA} called exons, which code for protein, interspersed with sequences called introns that do not. Therefore, a transcript must be ‘spliced’ before translation—the introns are removed and the exons joined.
            In some genes, certain exons can be optionally included or excluded from a transcript to produce different versions of the same protein that can often have very different functions. This is known as alternative splicing, and is essential for normal development. A large number of regulatory proteins control this process, many of which are only made in specific types of cells or tissues.
            Esrp1 and Esrp2 are two proteins that regulate alternative splicing in epithelial cells. These specialized cells form sheets that line most organs in the body and are found in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Although Esrp1 and Esrp2 have previously been studied in the laboratory using cultured cell lines, their roles have not been investigated in living animals.
            Bebee, Park et al. have now examined mice that are unable to produce one or both of these proteins. Mice that only lacked Esrp1 developed a cleft lip and palate. In mice that lacked both proteins, many organs failed to develop correctly and in some cases did not form at all. In the epidermis, the loss of Esrp1 and Esrp2 disrupted the splicing of the transcripts from genes that give epithelial cells many of their specialized characteristics, such as the ability to form sheets of cells with well formed junctions between them. This meant that epidermis that lacked Esrp1 and Esrp2 could not form a proper barrier layer, which is a crucial role of epithelia in skin as well as in other organs.
            In future, the mutant mice will be valuable for exploring how alternative splicing affects the development of epithelial cells and their properties.},

While the {RBPs} transformer2 alpha (Tra2α) and Tra2β have both been implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing, their relative contributions to this process are not well understood. Here we find simultaneous—but not individual—depletion of Tra2α and Tra2β induces substantial shifts in splicing of endogenous Tra2β target exons, and that both constitutive and alternative target exons are under dual Tra2α–Tra2β control. Target exons are enriched in genes associated with chromosome biology including {CHEK}1, which encodes a key {DNA} damage response protein. Dual Tra2 protein depletion reduces expression of full-length {CHK}1 protein, results in the accumulation of the {DNA} damage marker γH2AX and decreased cell viability.

Wärmepumpen und Elektrofahrzeuge im Wettbewerb mit fossilen Techniken auch durch staatlich bestimmte Preisbestandteile benachteiligt. Ausgehend von bestehenden Hemmnissen entwickelt die Studie Reformoptionen, um Sektorkopplungstechniken wirkungsvoll für den Klimaschutz zu nutzen und effizient in das Energiesystem zu integrieren. Dabei gilt es stets die Finanzierung des Stromnetzes und weiterer öffentlicher Aufgaben zu gewährleisten. Exemplarische Untersuchungen zeigen für das Jahr 2030, dass die untersuchten Reformoptionen die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und die Wirtschaftlichkeit von Sektorkopplungstechniken gegenüber fossilen Referenztechnologien gewährleisten können.},

Translation of these techniques into clinical science has also significantly advanced image analysis in neuro-oncology. This has created a need in the neurooncology community for understanding the mechanisms behind neural networks and deep learning, as close interaction of computer scientists and neuro-oncology researchers as well as realistic expectations about the possibilities (and limitations) of the current state-of-the-art is pivotal for successful translation of deep learning techniques into practice. In this review, we will briefly introduce the building blocks of neural networks with a particular focus on convolutional neural networks. We will explain why these networks excel at identifying relevant features and how they learn to associate these imaging features with (clinical) features of interest, such as genotype, or how they automatically segment structures of interest in the image volume. We will also discuss challenges for the more widespread use of these algorithms.},

	abstract = {As the {COVID}-19 spread globally, social distancing, self-isolation/quarantine, and national lockdowns have become crucial to control the pandemic. However, these measures may also lead to increases in social isolation, loneliness, and stress, which can alter the consumption of pornography habits. The aim of the study was thus to explore the interest pattern in pornography and coronavirus-themed pornography during the {COVID}-19 outbreak. Google Trends® was employed to determine the most popular porn websites (Porn, {XNXX}, {PornHub}, {xVideos}, and {xHamster}), and coronavirus-themed pornography worldwide and in six nations with different {COVID}-19 outbreak and self-isolation recommendations. We analyzed every search trend on Google® from January 9, 2020 to May 25, 2020 using “joint point regression analysis”. Comparisons of week relative search volume ({WRSV}) and temporal patterns were analyzed to assess the change of interest in search terms during nations lockdowns. Paired t-test was used to compare {WRSV} values among the porn websites during the national lockdowns and the equivalent timespan of the weeks in the previous 4 years. The research trend of almost every keyword increased with signiﬁcant inﬂection points for those nations with a straight “stay at home orders” (China, Italy, Spain, and France). “{PornHub}” and “Porn” showed the highest increase of interest worldwide with an average weekend percentage change ({AWPC}) of 4.9 and 3.8, respectively. The mean {WRSV} for keywords in {USA} and Sweden did not show a similar increase as the other nations. The {WRSV} percentage change with the historical data had a peak during the straight nations’ lockdowns (p {\textless} 0.01). All the nations had a signiﬁcant increase in {WRSV} coronavirus-themed pornography for each keyword (p {\textless} 0.01) with an {AWPC}, ranging worldwide between 18.5 and 61.8 (p {\textless} 0.01), after the beginning of selfquarantine. As strengths this study uses a big data technology to collect worldwide trend of interest, however, data are anonymous and do not allow analysis of subpopulation groups. In conclusion, we demonstrated an increased interest in pornography and coronavirus-themed pornography after the outbreak of {COVID}-19 in nations with a straight “stay at home orders”.},

	abstract = {The future of {RNA} origami writ large
Researchers have long fabricated intricate nanostructures from carefully linked {DNA} strands. Now they can use {RNA} made by gene expression, which avoids the costly strand synthesis and lengthy annealing steps necessary with {DNA} origami. Geary et al. used molecular modeling to extend the size of folded {RNA} origami structures (see the Perspective by Leontis and Westhof). The modeling revealed assembly patterns for linking single-stranded {RNA} into A-form helices. The authors created two-dimensional structures as large as 660 nucleotides on mica surfaces.
Science, this issue p. 799; see also p. 732
Artificial {DNA} and {RNA} structures have been used as scaffolds for a variety of nanoscale devices. In comparison to {DNA} structures, {RNA} structures have been limited in size, but they also have advantages: {RNA} can fold during transcription and thus can be genetically encoded and expressed in cells. We introduce an architecture for designing artificial {RNA} structures that fold from a single strand, in which arrays of antiparallel {RNA} helices are precisely organized by {RNA} tertiary motifs and a new type of crossover pattern. We constructed {RNA} tiles that assemble into hexagonal lattices and demonstrated that lattices can be made by annealing and/or cotranscriptional folding. Tiles can be scaled up to 660 nucleotides in length, reaching a size comparable to that of large natural ribozymes.
The size of {RNA} origami nanostructures has been increased with a distinct assembly pattern. [Also see Perspective by Leontis and Westhof]

	abstract = {A new auditory phenomenon has been identified in the acoustic impulse response of the human ear. Using a signal averaging technique, a study has been made of the response of the closed external acoustic meatus to acoustic impulses near to the threshold of audibility. Particular attention has been paid to the waveform of the response at post excitation times in excess of 5 ms. No previous worker appears to have extended observations into this region. The response observed after about 5 ms is not a simple extension of the initial response attributable to the middle ear. The oscillatory response decay time constant was found to change from approximately 1 ms to over 12 ms at about this time. The slowly decaying response component was present in all normal ears tested, but was not present in ears with cochlear deafness. This component of the response appears to have its origin in some nonlinear mechanism probably located in the cochlea, responding mechanically to auditory stimulation, and dependent upon the normal functioning of the cochlea transduction process. A cochlear reflection hypothesis received some support from these results.},

	abstract = {Combining {mRNA} and {EST} data in splicing graphs with whole genome alignments, we discover alternative splicing events that are conserved in both human and mouse transcriptomes. 1,964 of 19,156 (10\%) loci examined contain one or more such alternative splicing events, with 2,698 total events. These events represent a lower bound on the amount of alternative splicing in the human genome. Also, as these alternative splicing events are conserved between the human and mouse transcriptomes they should be enriched for functionally significant alternative splicing events, free from much of the noise found in the {EST} libraries. Further classification of these alternative splicing events reveals that 1,037 (38.4\%) are due to exon skipping, 497 (18.4\%) are due to alternative 3' splice sites, 214 (7.9\%) are due to alternative 5' splice sites, 75 (2.8\%) are due to intron retention and the other 875 (32.4\%) are due to other, more complicated, alternative splicing events. In addition, genomic sequences nearby these alternative splicing events display increased sequence conservation. Both the alternatively spliced exons and the proximal intron show increased levels of genomic conservation relative to constitutively spliced exons. For exon skipping events both intron regions flanking the exon are conserved while for alternative 5' and 3' splicing events the conservation is greater near the alternative splice site.},

	abstract = {Removal of introns from messenger {RNA} precursors (pre-{mRNA} splicing) is an essential step for the expression of most eukaryotic genes. Alternative splicing enables the regulated generation of multiple {mRNA} and protein products from a single gene. Cancer cells have general as well as cancer type-specific and subtype-specific alterations in the splicing process that can have prognostic value and contribute to every hallmark of cancer progression, including cancer immune responses. These splicing alterations are often linked to the occurrence of cancer driver mutations in genes encoding either core components or regulators of the splicing machinery. Of therapeutic relevance, the transcriptomic landscape of cancer cells makes them particularly vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of splicing. Small-molecule splicing modulators are currently in clinical trials and, in addition to splice site-switching antisense oligonucleotides, offer the promise of novel and personalized approaches to cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efﬁcient inference, focusing on mean-ﬁeld or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a signiﬁcant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying ﬂexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing ﬂow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing ﬂows to develop categories of ﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal ﬂows and provide a uniﬁed view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

The theoretical and historical underpinnings of techniques are prominent features of the presentation throughout, information that does much to help trouble-shoot experimental problems. For the fourth edition of this classic work, the content has been entirely recast to include nucleic-acid based methods selected as the most widely used and valuable in molecular and cellular biology laboratories. Core chapters from the third edition have been revised to feature current strategies and approaches to the preparation and cloning of nucleic acids, gene transfer, and expression analysis. They are augmented by 12 new chapters which show how {DNA}, {RNA}, and proteins should be prepared, evaluated, and manipulated, and how data generation and analysis can be handled. The new content includes methods for studying interactions between cellular components, such as microarrays, next-generation sequencing technologies, {RNA} interference, and epigenetic analysis using {DNA} methylation techniques and chromatin immunoprecipitation. To make sense of the wealth of data produced by these techniques, a bioinformatics chapter describes the use of analytical tools for comparing sequences of genes and proteins and identifying common expression patterns among sets of genes. Please take a look at our book preview site at molecularcloning.com. Building on thirty years of trust, reliability, and authority, the fourth edition of Molecular Cloning is the new gold standard--the one indispensable molecular biology laboratory manual and reference source.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference ({VI}), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. {VI} has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind {VI} is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of {VI} applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in {VI} and highlight important open problems. {VI} is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.

Here, we show that enhanced micromixing can be achieved in topologically simple and easily fabricated planar 2D microchannels by simply introducing curvature and changes in width in a prescribed manner. This goal is accomplished by harnessing a synergistic combination of (i) Dean vortices that arise in the vertical plane of curved channels as a consequence of an interplay between inertial, centrifugal, and viscous effects, and (ii) expansion vortices that arise in the horizontal plane due to an abrupt increase in a conduit's cross-sectional area. We characterize these effects by using confocal microscopy of aqueous fluorescent dye streams and by observing binding interactions between an intercalating dye and double-stranded {DNA}. These mixing approaches are versatile and scalable and can be straightforwardly integrated as generic components in a variety of lab-on-a-chip systems.},

	abstract = {Inertial microﬂuidic technology, which can manipulate the target particle entirely relying on the microchannel characteristic geometry and intrinsic hydrodynamic eﬀect, has attracted great attention due to its fascinating advantages of high throughput, simplicity, high resolution and low cost. As a passive microﬂuidic technology, inertial microﬂuidics can precisely focus, separate, mix or trap target particles in a continuous and high-ﬂow-speed manner without any extra external force ﬁeld. Therefore, it is promising and has great potential for a wide range of industrial, biomedical and clinical applications. In the regime of inertial microﬂuidics, particle migration due to inertial eﬀects forms multiple equilibrium positions in straight channels. However, this is not promising for particle detection and separation. Secondary ﬂow, which is a relatively minor ﬂow perpendicular to the primary ﬂow, may reduce the number of equilibrium positions as well as modify the location of particles focusing within channel cross sections by applying an additional hydrodynamic drag. For secondary ﬂow, the pattern and magnitude can be controlled by the well-designed channel structure, such as curvature or disturbance obstacle. The magnitude and form of generated secondary ﬂow are greatly dependent on the disturbing microstructure. Therefore, many inventive and delicate applications of secondary ﬂow in inertial microﬂuidics have been reported. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the usage of the secondary ﬂow in inertial microﬂuidics.},

This collective study on the fluid-particle-structure phenomena in microchannels involving fluid inertia is called, “inertial microfluidics”. Beyond theoretical studies, now inertial microfluidics has been gaining much attention from various research fields ranging from biomedicine to industry. Despite the positive contributions, there is still a lack of clear understanding of intrinsic inertial effects in microchannels.

Thus, we have developed a computational approach, {DXM}, to deconvolve the methylation profiles of major allelic subpopulations from the bisulfite sequencing data of a heterogeneous sample. {DXM} does not require prior knowledge of the number of subpopulations or types of cells to expect. We benchmark {DXM}’s performance and demonstrate improvement over existing methods. We further experimentally validate {DXM} predicted allelic subpopulation-methylation profiles in four Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas ({DLBCLs}). Lastly, as proof-of-concept, we apply {DXM} to a cohort of 31 {DLBCLs} and relate allelic subpopulation methylation profiles to relapse. We thus demonstrate that {DXM} can robustly find allelic subpopulation methylation profiles that may contribute to disease progression using bisulfite sequencing data of any heterogeneous sample.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

          , 
            In this study, we have investigated the motion of polystyrene microparticles inside a sessile droplet of water actuated by surface acoustic waves ({SAWs}), which produce an acoustic streaming flow ({ASF}) and impart an acoustic radiation force ({ARF}) on the particles. We have categorized four distinct regimes (R1–R4) of particle aggregation that depend on the particle diameter, the {SAW} frequency, the acoustic wave field (travelling or standing), the acoustic waves' attenuation length, and the droplet volume. The particles are concentrated at the centre of the droplet in the form of a bead (R1), around the periphery of the droplet in the form of a ring (R2), at the side of the droplet in the form of an isolated island (R3), and close to the centre of the droplet in the form of a smaller ring (R4). The {ASF}-based drag force, the travelling or standing {SAW}-based {ARF}, and the centrifugal force are utilized in various combinations to produce these distinct regimes. For simplicity, we fixed the fluid volume at 5 μL, varied the {SAW} actuation frequency (10, 20, 80, and 133 {MHz}), and tested several particle diameters in the range 1–30 μm to explicitly demonstrate the regimes R1–R4. We have further demonstrated the separation of particles (1 and 10 μm, 3 and 5 μm) using mixed regime configurations (R1 and R2, R2 and R4, respectively).},

The capabilities that we designed to be inherent to {AutoPAD} (e.g., automatic zone alignment and design refactoring) highlight its potential use in nearly any paper-based microfluidic device application and for creating nearly any desired design, which we demonstrate through the recreation of numerous device designs from the literature.},

	abstract = {We propose a new hydrophoretic method for continuous blood cell separation using a microfluidic device composed of slanted obstacles and filtration obstacles. The slanted obstacles have a larger height and gap than the particles in order to focus them to a sidewall by hydrophoresis. In the successive structure, the height and gap of the filtration obstacles with a filtration pore are set between the diameters of small and large particles, which defines the critical separation diameter. Accordingly, the particles smaller than the criterion freely pass through the gap and keep their focused position. In contrast, the particles larger than the criterion collide against the filtration obstacle and move into the filtration pore. The microfluidic device was characterized with polystyrene beads with a minimum diameter difference of 7.3\%. We completely separated polystyrene microbeads of 9 and 12 µm diameter with a separation resolution of ∼6.2. This resolution is increased by 6.4-fold compared with our previous separation method based on hydrophoresis (S. Choi and J.-K. Park, Lab Chip, 2007, 7, 890, ref. 1). In the isolation of white blood cells ({WBCs}) from red blood cells ({RBCs}), the microfluidic device isolated {WBCs} with 210-fold enrichment within a short filtration time of ∼0.3 s. These results show that the device can be useful for the binary separation of a wide range of biological particles by size. The hydrophoretic filtration as a sample preparation unit offers potential for a power-free cell sorter to be integrated into disposable lab-on-a-chip devices.},

	abstract = {The quantification of blood cells provides critical information about a patient's health status. Sophisticated analytical equipment, such as hematology analyzers, have been developed to perform these measurements, but limited-resource settings often lack the infrastructure required to purchase, operate, and maintain instrumentation. To address these practical challenges, paper-based microfluidic devices have emerged as a platform to develop diagnostic assays specifically for use at the point-of-care. To date, paper-based microfluidic devices have been used broadly in diagnostic assays that apply immunoassay, clinical chemistry, and electrochemistry techniques. The analysis of cells, however, has been largely overlooked. In this communication, we demonstrate a paper-based microfluidic device that enables the controlled transport of red blood cells ({RBCs}) and the measurement of the hematocrit-the ratio of {RBC} packed cell volume to total volume of whole blood. The properties of paper, device treatment, and device geometry affect the overall extent and reproducibility of transport of {RBCs}. Ultimately, we developed an inexpensive ({US}\$0.03 per device) thermometer-styled device where the distance traveled by {RBCs} is proportional to the hematocrit. These results provide a foundation for the design of paper-based microfluidic devices that enable the separation and detection of cells in limited-resource settings.},

However, identifying subpopulation-level changes in a heterogeneous sample remains challenging. Thus, we have developed a computational approach, {DXM}, to deconvolve the methylation profiles of major allelic subpopulations from the bisulfite sequencing data of a heterogeneous sample. {DXM} does not require prior knowledge of the number of subpopulations or types of cells to expect. We benchmark {DXM}’s performance and demonstrate improvement over existing methods. We further experimentally validate {DXM} predicted allelic subpopulation-methylation profiles in four Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas ({DLBCLs}). Lastly, as proof-of-concept, we apply {DXM} to a cohort of 31 {DLBCLs} and relate allelic subpopulation methylation profiles to relapse. We thus demonstrate that {DXM} can robustly find allelic subpopulation methylation profiles that may contribute to disease progression using bisulfite sequencing data of any heterogeneous sample.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The whole blood could be introduced into the microchannel via the effects of capillary forces alone, i.e., there was no need for any external driving force. A microfluidic chip for plasma separation including a cross-flow microchannel consisting of a straight main microchannel and a filtration microchannel has been proposed. The microfluidic chip used for plasma separation is fabricated from a single polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}) mold and sealed with an etched glass substrate. Since filtration microchannel depth is less than 2 μm, plasma can be extracted from whole blood. The merits of this design are its simple structure, high separation efficiency and without any external driving force. The experimental results show that this design can extract at least 0.02 μl of plasma from whole blood within 25 s and with a residual cell concentration of less than 0.07 \% in the purified plasma.},

This method is compatible with portable instrumentation that can be deployed in the field. The method consists of serially diluting blood samples first with sodium dodecyl sulfate dissolved in phosphate buffered saline, then in acridine orange dissolved in phosphate buffered saline, followed by fluorescence and dark field imaging with low magnification objectives. Image analysis is performed to extract cell counts and differentials. We performed a paired analysis of 20 volunteers with complete blood count values both within and beyond the normal reference range using a commercial automated hematology analyzer and the image-based method, with the new method achieving accuracies comparable to that of the commercial system. Because the sample preparation and imaging are simple and inexpensive to implement, this method has applications for pediatrics, clinician offices, and global health in regions that do not have access to central hematology laboratories.},

Special attention is devoted to estimate the effects of variable hydraulic resistance over different flow regimes, influence of suspended {RBC} particulates on the non-Newtonian flow characteristics and implications of a dynamically-evolving contact angle. Flow characteristics depicting advancement of the fluid within the microfluidic channel turn out to be typically non-linear, as per relative instantaneous strengths of the capillary forces and viscous resistances. It is found that the greater the ‘pseudoplasticity’ of the blood, the weaker the retarding shear forces. The driving forces, on the other hand, become stronger with time, on account of a reduction of contact angle with a decrease of blood flow velocity, although this strengthening is less prominent for blood samples with greater ‘pseudoplasticity’. It is revealed that {RBCs} suspended in blood samples have a strong influence on the effective blood viscosity, and consequently, may drive the fluid significantly faster into the microchannel, especially when the characteristic length scales of the suspensions approach the hydraulic radius of the channel.},

Capillary microfluidics can deliver liquids in a pre-programmed manner without peripheral equipment by exploiting surface tension effects encoded by the geometry and surface chemistry of a microchannel. Here, we review the history and progress of microchannel-based capillary microfluidics spanning over three decades. To both reflect recent experimental and conceptual progress, and distinguish from paper-based capillary microfluidics, we adopt the more recent terminology of capillaric circuits ({CCs}). We identify three distinct waves of development driven by microfabrication technologies starting with early implementations in industry using machining and lamination, followed by development in the context of micro total analysis systems (μ{TAS}) and lab-on-a-chip devices using cleanroom microfabrication, and finally a third wave that arose with advances in rapid prototyping technologies. We discuss the basic physical laws governing capillary flow, deconstruct {CCs} into basic circuit elements including capillary pumps, stop valves, trigger valves, retention valves, and so on, and describe their operating principle and limitations. We discuss applications of {CCs} starting with the most common usage in automating liquid delivery steps for immunoassays, and highlight emerging applications such as {DNA} analysis. Finally, we highlight recent developments in rapid prototyping of {CCs} and the benefits offered including speed, low cost, and greater degrees of freedom in {CC} design. The combination of better analytical models and lower entry barriers (thanks to advances in rapid manufacturing) make {CCs} both a fertile research area and an increasingly capable technology for user-friendly and high-performance laboratory and diagnostic tests.},

	abstract = {Abstract With the rapid development of new technologies, including artificial intelligence and genome sequencing, radiogenomics has emerged as a state-of-the-art science in the field of individualized medicine. Radiogenomics combines a large volume of quantitative data extracted from medical images with individual genomic phenotypes and constructs a prediction model through deep learning to stratify patients, guide therapeutic strategies, and evaluate clinical outcomes. Recent studies of various types of tumors demonstrate the predictive value of radiogenomics. And some of the issues in the radiogenomic analysis and the solutions from prior works are presented. Although the workflow criteria and international agreed guidelines for statistical methods need to be confirmed, radiogenomics represents a repeatable and cost-effective approach for the detection of continuous changes and is a promising surrogate for invasive interventions. Therefore, radiogenomics could facilitate computer-aided diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of the prognosis in patients with tumors in the routine clinical setting. Here, we summarize the integrated process of radiogenomics and introduce the crucial strategies and statistical algorithms involved in current studies.},

	abstract = {{PurposeTo} evaluate the association of multiparametric and multiregional magnetic resonance ({MR}) imaging features with key molecular characteristics in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.Materials and {MethodsRetrospective} data evaluation was approved by the local ethics committee, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Preoperative {MR} imaging features were correlated with key molecular characteristics within a single-institution cohort of 152 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Preoperative {MR} imaging features (n = 31) included multiparametric (anatomic and diffusion-, perfusion-, and susceptibility-weighted images) and multiregional (contrast-enhancing regions and hyperintense regions at nonenhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging) information with histogram quantification of tumor volumes, volume ratios, apparent diffusion coefficients, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and intratumoral susceptibility signals. Molecular characteristics determined included global {DNA} methylation subgroups (eg, mesenchymal, {RTK} I “{PGFRA},” {RTK} {II} “classic”), {MGMT} promoter methylation status, and hallmark copy number variations ({EGFR}, {PDGFRA}, {MDM}4, and {CDK}4 amplification; {PTEN}, {CDKN}2A, {NF}1, and {RB}1 loss). Univariate analyses (voxel-lesion symptom mapping for tumor location, Wilcoxon test for all other {MR} imaging features) and machine learning models were applied to study the strength of association and discriminative value of {MR} imaging features for predicting underlying molecular characteristics.{ResultsThere} was no tumor location predilection for any of the assessed molecular parameters (permutation-adjusted P {\textgreater} .05). Univariate imaging parameter associations were noted for {EGFR} amplification and {CDKN}2A loss, with both demonstrating increased Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood volume and Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood flow values (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 63\%–69\%, false discovery rate–adjusted P {\textless} .05). Subjecting all {MR} imaging features to machine learning–based classification enabled prediction of {EGFR} amplification status and the {RTK} {II} glioblastoma subgroup with a moderate, yet significantly greater, accuracy (63\% for {EGFR} [P {\textless} .01], 61\% for {RTK} {II} [P = .01]) than prediction by chance; prediction accuracy for all other molecular parameters was not significant.{ConclusionThe} authors found associations between established {MR} imaging features and molecular characteristics, although not of sufficient strength to enable generation of machine learning classification models for reliable and clinically meaningful prediction of molecular characteristics in patients with glioblastoma.© {RSNA}, 2016Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

Such systems are totally autonomous and use capillarity to move fluids. In this work we investigate the dynamics of capillary flows with {COMSOL} Multiphysics. It is shown that the square root dependency for capillary filling, namely the Lucas-Washburn law for cylindrical ducts, is recovered. Moreover, different geometric configurations such are stop valves and trigger valves have been numerically studied and are presented in this work. Finally, capillary filaments, a.k.a.

	abstract = {Background: Huge progress has been made in the development of array- or sequencing-based technologies for {DNA} methylation analysis. The Illumina Infinium® Human Methylation 450K {BeadChip} (Illumina Inc., {CA}, {USA}) allows the simultaneous quantitative monitoring of more than 480,000 {CpG} positions, enabling large-scale epigenotyping studies. However, the assay combines two different assay chemistries, which may cause a bias in the analysis if all signals are merged as a unique source of methylation measurement. Materials \& methods: We confirm in three 450K data sets that Infinium I signals are more stable and cover a wider dynamic range of methylation values than Infinium {II} signals. We evaluated the methylation profile of Infinium I and {II} probes obtained with different normalization protocols and compared these results with the methylation values of a subset of {CpGs} analyzed by pyrosequencing. Results: We developed a subset quantile normalization approach for the processing of 450K {BeadChips}. The Infinium I signals were used as ‘anchors’ to normalize Infinium {II} signals at the level of probe coverage categories. Our normalization approach outperformed alternative normalization or correction approaches in terms of bias correction and methylation signal estimation. We further implemented a complete preprocessing protocol that solves most of the issues currently raised by 450K array users. Conclusion: We developed a complete preprocessing pipeline for 450K {BeadChip} data using an original subset quantile normalization approach that performs both sample normalization and efficient Infinium I/{II} shift correction. The scripts, being freely available from the authors, will allow researchers to concentrate on the biological analysis of data, such as the identification of {DNA} methylation signatures.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the efficiency of capillary pump analytically in circular, square and rectangular channels with results verified by experiment. The effect of liquid momentum is analyzed with respect to channel size and equations are developed to enable most efficient fluid pumping. It is found that the momentum term is negligible at channel cross-cut area {\textless} 0.1 mm2 while it has a significant contribution at {\textgreater} 0.3 mm2 region. The optimized equations show that the most efficient pumping and thereby the quickest liquid filling is accomplished in square shaped channel when compared with rectangular and circular channels. Generally, the longer the filling distance, or the longer the filling time, the larger the channel size is required after optimization, and vice versa. For the rectangular channel with channel height fixed, the channel width requirement to maximize the ability of capillary pump is obtained and discussed. Experimental verifications are conducted based on the measurement of filling distance versus time, and the simulation results are well correlated with the testing results. The equations developed in the paper provide a reference for the microfluidic channel design, such that the channel filling speed can be maximized.},

In this review, we examine the advances in paper-based microﬂuidic diagnostics for medical diagnosis in the context of global health from 2007 to 2016. The theory of ﬂuid transport in paper is ﬁrst presented. The next section examines the strategies that have been employed to control ﬂuid and analyte transport in paper-based assays. Tasks such as mixing, timing, and sequential ﬂuid delivery have been achieved in paper and have enabled analytical capabilities comparable to those of conventional laboratory methods. The following section examines paper-based sample processing and analysis. The most impactful advancement here has been the translation of nucleic acid analysis to a paperbased format. Smartphone-based analysis is another exciting development with potential for wide dissemination.

	abstract = {The sustainability of aquaculture has been debated intensely since 2000, when a review on the net contribution of aquaculture to world fish supplies was published in Nature. This paper reviews the developments in global aquaculture from 1997 to 2017, incorporating all industry sub-sectors and highlighting the integration of aquaculture in the global food system. Inland aquaculture—especially in Asia—has contributed the most to global production volumes and food security. Major gains have also occurred in aquaculture feed efficiency and fish nutrition, lowering the fish-in–fish-out ratio for all fed species, although the dependence on marine ingredients persists and reliance on terrestrial ingredients has increased. The culture of both molluscs and seaweed is increasingly recognized for its ecosystem services; however, the quantification, valuation, and market development of these services remain rare. The potential for molluscs and seaweed to support global nutritional security is underexploited. Management of pathogens, parasites, and pests remains a sustainability challenge industry-wide, and the effects of climate change on aquaculture remain uncertain and difficult to validate. Pressure on the aquaculture industry to embrace comprehensive sustainability measures during this 20-year period have improved the governance, technology, siting, and management in many cases.},

Here we review memory-editing research with a focus on improving the treatment of psychopathology. Studies highlight two windows of memory vulnerability: initial storage, or consolidation; and re-storage after retrieval, or reconsolidation. Techniques have been identified that can modify memories at each stage, but translating these methods from animal models to humans has been challenging and implementation into clinical therapies has produced inconsistent benefits. The science of memory editing is more complicated and nuanced than fiction, but its rapid development holds promise for future applications.},

	abstract = {Following the development of microfluidic systems, there has been a high tendency towards developing lab-on-a-chip devices for biochemical applications. A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable platforms for point of care applications. Among the different microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics ({DMF}) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the {DMF} platforms, and evaluate the feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of {DMF} systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the {DMF} devices. Success in developing the lab-on-a-chip {DMF} devices will be concluded based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.},

Methods for droplet generation can be either passive or active, where the former generates droplets without external actuation, and the latter makes use of additional energy input in promoting interfacial instabilities for droplet generation. A unified physical understanding of both passive and active droplet generation is beneficial for effectively developing new techniques meeting various demands arising from applications. Our review of passive approaches focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of breakup modes of droplet generation occurring in microfluidic cross-flow, co-flow, flow-focusing, and step emulsification configurations. The review of active approaches covers the state-of-the-art techniques employing either external forces from electrical, magnetic and centrifugal fields or methods of modifying intrinsic properties of flows or fluids such as velocity, viscosity, interfacial tension, channel wettability, and fluid density, with a focus on their implementations and actuation mechanisms.

A narrow beam of surface acoustic waves ({SAWs}) that emanated from the {SF}-{IDT} exerted an acoustic radiation force ({ARF}) on the droplet's water–oil interface due to the acoustic contrast between the two fluids. The {ARF} split the mother droplet into two or more daughter droplets of various volumes in a split ratio that was readily controlled by varying the applied voltage or the flow rate. Theoretical estimates of the {ARF} acting on the droplet interface were used to investigate the mechanism underlying the droplet splitting properties and size control. The versatility of the acoustomicrofluidic device operation was demonstrated by selectively pushing/placing a suspended polystyrene particle into a specific/preferred split daughter droplet using the direct {ARF} acting on the particle.},

Moreover, by targeting sequences necessary for viral replication, our results indicate that a viral gene drive can be used as a strategy to suppress a viral infection.

          , 
            
              Reactions performed in uniform microscale volumes have enabled numerous applications in the analysis of rare entities (
              e.g.
              cells and molecules). Here, highly monodisperse aqueous droplets are formed by simply mixing microscale multi-material particles, consisting of concentric hydrophobic outer and hydrophilic inner layers, with oil and water. The particles are manufactured in batch using a 3D printed device to co-flow four concentric streams of polymer precursors which are polymerized with {UV} light. The cross-sectional shapes of the particles are altered by microfluidic nozzle design in the 3D printed device. Once a particle encapsulates an aqueous volume, each “dropicle” provides uniform compartmentalization and customizable shape-coding for each sample volume to enable multiplexing of uniform reactions in a scalable manner. We implement an enzymatically-amplified immunoassay using the dropicle system, yielding a detection limit of {\textless}1 {pM} with a dynamic range of at least 3 orders of magnitude. Multiplexing using two types of shape-coded particles was demonstrated without cross talk, laying a foundation for democratized single-entity assays.},

	abstract = {Simple mixing of aqueous and oil solutions with amphiphilic particles leads to the spontaneous formation of uniform reaction volumes (dropicles) that can enable numerous applications in the analysis of biological entities (e.g., cells and molecules). Approaches to manufacture such amphiphilic particles are just starting to be investigated. Here, we investigate the tunable manufacturing of concentric amphiphilic particles, with outer hydrophobic and inner hydrophilic layers, fabricated by ﬂowing reactive precursor streams through a 3D printed device with coaxial microﬂuidic channels, and curing the structured ﬂow by {UV} exposure through a photomask. The dimensions of the engineered amphiphilic particles, including height, inner and outer diameters, and thicknesses of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers, are precisely controlled by modulating the {UV} exposure time, the precursor ﬂow rate ratios, and the size of the channel in the exposure region. The particle design is systematically engineered to hold a wide range of droplet volumes, that is, from a few hundred picoliters to several nanoliters. We show that the particle size can be signiﬁcantly reduced from previous reports to not only hold subnanoliter drops but the shape can also be tuned to increase the seeding density and orientation of dropicles within a well plate for imaging and analysis.},

Application to six {AD}-related traits predicts hundreds of new significant brain {CpGs} associated with {AD}, some of which are further validated experimentally. {EWASplus} also performs well on data collected from independent cohorts and different brain regions. Genes found near top {EWASplus} loci are enriched for kinases and for genes with evidence for physical interactions with known {AD} genes.

use {dCas}9 and designed {sgRNAs} to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform

Escherichia coli σ70 promoters that are repressed by
corresponding {sgRNAs}, and these interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These

({\textless} 1.3-fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the
Boolean-complete {NOR} gate and a 3-gate circuit consisting of four layered {sgRNAs}. The synthetic
circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by designing
output {sgRNAs} to target an E. coli transcription factor ({malT}).

However, the hydrophobicity of {PDMS} leads to non-specific adsorption of proteins and other molecules such as therapeutic drugs, limiting its broader use. Here, we introduce a simple method for preparing {PDMS} materials to improve hydrophilicity and decrease non-specific protein adsorption while retaining cellular biocompatibility, transparency, and good mechanical properties without the need for any post-cure surface treatment. This approach utilizes smart copolymers comprised of poly(ethylene glycol) ({PEG}) and {PDMS} segments ({PDMS}-{PEG}) that, when blended with {PDMS} during device manufacture, spontaneously segregate to surfaces in contact with aqueous solutions and reduce the hydrophobicity without any added manufacturing steps. {PDMS}-{PEG}-modified {PDMS} samples showed contact angles as low as 23.6° ± 1° and retained this hydrophilicity for at least twenty months. Their improved wettability was confirmed using capillary flow experiments. Modified devices exhibited considerably reduced non-specific adsorption of albumin, lysozyme, and immunoglobulin G. The modified {PDMS} was biocompatible, displaying no adverse effects when used in a simple liver-on-a-chip model using primary rat hepatocytes. This {PDMS} modification method can be further applied in analytical separations, biosensing, cell studies, and drug-related studies.},

	title = {The Pan-Cancer Landscape of Coamplification of the Tyrosine Kinases {KIT}, {KDR}, and {PDGFRA}},
	volume = {25},
	issn = {1549-490X},
	doi = {10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0528},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Amplifications of receptor tyrosine kinases ({RTKS}) are therapeutic targets in multiple tumor types (e.g. {HER}2 in breast cancer), and amplification of the chromosome 4 segment harboring the three {RTKs} {KIT}, {PDGFRA}, and {KDR} (4q12amp) may be similarly targetable. The presence of 4q12amp has been sporadically reported in small tumor specific series but a large-scale analysis is lacking. We assess the pan-cancer landscape of 4q12amp and provide early clinical support for the feasibility of targeting this amplicon.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Tumor specimens from 132,872 patients with advanced cancer were assayed with hybrid capture based comprehensive genomic profiling which assays 186-315 genes for all classes of genomic alterations, including amplifications. Baseline demographic data were abstracted, and presence of 4q12amp was defined as 6 or more copies of {KIT}/{KDR}/{PDGFRA}. Concurrent alterations and treatment outcomes with matched therapies were explored in a subset of cases.
{RESULTS}: Overall 0.65\% of cases harbored 4q12amp at a median copy number of 10 (range 6-344). Among cancers with {\textgreater}100 cases in this series, glioblastomas, angiosarcomas, and osteosarcomas were enriched for 4q12amp at 4.7\%, 4.8\%, and 6.4\%, respectively (all p {\textless} 0.001), giving an overall sarcoma (n = 6,885) incidence of 1.9\%. Among 99 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases harboring 4q12amp, 50 (50\%) lacked any other known driver of {NSLCC}. Four index cases plus a previously reported case on treatment with empirical {TKIs} monotherapy had stable disease on average exceeding 20 months.
{CONCLUSION}: We define 4q12amp as a significant event across the pan-cancer landscape, comparable to known pan-cancer targets such as {NTRK} and microsatellite instability, with notable enrichment in several cancers such as osteosarcoma where standard treatment is limited. The responses to available {TKIs} observed in index cases strongly suggest 4q12amp is a druggable oncogenic target across cancers that warrants a focused drug development strategy.
{IMPLICATIONS} {FOR} {PRACTICE}: Coamplification of the receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) {KIT}/{KDR}/{PDGFRA} (4q12amp) is present broadly across cancers (0.65\%), with enrichment in osteosarcoma and gliomas. Evidence for this amplicon having an oncogenic role is the mutual exclusivity of 4q12amp to other known drivers in 50\% of pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases. Furthermore, preliminary clinical evidence for driver status comes from four index cases of patients empirically treated with commercially available tyrosine kinase inhibitors with activity against {KIT}/{KDR}/{PDGFRA} who had stable disease for 20 months on average. The sum of these lines of evidence suggests further clinical and preclinical investigation of 4q12amp is warranted as the possible basis for a pan-cancer drug development strategy.},

We also find evidence for functional transactivation of {PDGFRA} by {EGFR} and {EGF}-induced receptor heterodimerization, both of which are abolished by {EGFR} inhibitors. These results indicate that {GBM} growth responses to targeted therapies previously tested in clinical trials are strongly influenced by the balance of {EGFR} and {PDGFRA} activation in individual cells, which is heterogeneous at baseline.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma Multiforme ({GBM}) is the most frequent and lethal primary brain cancer. Due to its therapeutic resistance and aggressiveness, its clinical management is challenging. Platelet-derived Growth Factor ({PDGF}) genes have been enrolled as drivers of this tumour progression as well as potential therapeutic targets. As detailed understanding of the expression pattern of {PDGF} system in the context of {GBM} intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity is lacking in the literature, this study aims at characterising {PDGF} expression in different histologically-defined {GBM} regions as well as investigating correlation of these genes expression with parameters related to poor prognosis. Z-score normalised expression values of {PDGF} subunits from multiple slices of 36 {GBMs}, alongside with clinical and genomic data on those {GBMs} patients, were compiled from Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project – Allen Institute for Brain Science data sets. {PDGF} subunits show differential expression over distinct regions of {GBM} and {PDGF} family is heterogeneously expressed among different brain lobes affected by {GBM}. Further, {PDGF} family expression correlates with bad prognosis factors: age at {GBM} diagnosis, Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog deletion and Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 mutation. These findings may aid on clinical management of {GBM} and development of targeted curative therapies against this devastating tumour.},

	abstract = {Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 ({PTEN}) is a tumor suppressor gene deleted or mutated in many human cancers such as glioblastoma, spinal tumors, prostate, bladder, adrenals, thyroid, breast, endometrium, and colon cancers. They result from loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) for the {PTEN} gene on chromosome 10q23. Previous studies reported that various drugs, chemicals, and foods can up-regulate {PTEN} {mRNA} and protein expression in different cell lines, and they may be useful in the future prevention and/or treatment of these cancers. {PTEN} has also been observed to have prognostic significance and is gradually being accepted as an independent prognostic factor. This will help in monitoring disease progression and/or recurrence, with a view to improving treatment outcomes and reducing the associated morbidity and mortality from these cancers. Neprilysin ({NEP}) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that cleaves and inactivates some biologically active peptides thus switching off signal transduction at the cell surface. Decreased {NEP} expression in many cancers has been reported. {NEP} can form a complex with {PTEN} and enhance {PTEN} recruitment to the plasma membrane as well as stabilize its phosphatase activity. {MicroRNA}-21 ({miR}-21) post-transcriptionally down-regulates the expression of {PTEN} and stimulates growth and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}) (lung Ca), suggesting that this may be a potential therapeutic target in the future treatment of {NSCLC}. {PTEN} is a tumor suppressor gene associated with many human cancers. This has diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic significance in the management of many human cancers, and may be a target for new drug development in the future.},

	abstract = {It is well-known, but frequently overlooked, that low- and high-throughput molecular data may contain batch effects, i.e., systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a biologically significant finding. An integral step toward reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium {HumanMethylation}450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two sources of batch effects: row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function, {ComBat}, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In the “initial analysis,” the application of {ComBat} to an unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant ({FDR} {\textless} 0.05) {DNA} methylation differences, despite none present prior to correction. Suspicious of this dramatic change, a “revised processing” included changes to our analysis as well as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports conclusions made by an article previously published in this journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is thoughtful study design, every {DNA} methylation microarray analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve as a reminder to the broader community to establish research questions a priori, ensure that they match with study design and encourage communication between technicians and analysts.},

The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of intratumoral heterogeneity on classification confidence.We used neuronavigation to acquire 133 image-guided and spatially separated stereotactic biopsy samples from 16 adult patients with a diffuse glioma (7 {IDH}-wildtype and 2 {IDH}-mutant glioblastoma, 6 diffuse astrocytoma, {IDH}-mutant and 1 oligodendroglioma, {IDH}-mutant and 1p19q codeleted), which we characterized using {DNA} methylation arrays. Samples were obtained from regions with and without abnormalities on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery {MRI}. Methylation profiles were analyzed to devise a 3-dimensional reconstruction of (epi)genetic heterogeneity. Tumor purity was assessed from clonal methylation sites.Molecular aberrations indicated that tumor was found outside imaging abnormalities, underlining the infiltrative nature of this tumor and the limitations of current routine imaging modalities. We demonstrate that tumor purity is highly variable between samples and explains a substantial part of apparent epigenetic spatial heterogeneity. We observed that {DNA} methylation subtypes are often, but not always, conserved in space taking tumor purity and prediction accuracy into account.Our results underscore the infiltrative nature of diffuse gliomas and suggest that {DNA} methylation subtypes are relatively concordant in this tumor type, although some heterogeneity exists.},

In genome wide screening studies, the assessment of tumor purity is typically performed by means of computational methods that exploit somatic copy number aberrations.We present a strategy, called Purity Assessment from clonal {MEthylation} Sites ({PAMES}), which uses the methylation level of a few dozen, highly clonal, tumor type specific {CpG} sites to estimate the purity of tumor samples, without the need of a matched benign control. We trained and validated our method in more than 6000 samples from different datasets. Purity estimates by {PAMES} were highly concordant with other state-of-the-art tools and its evaluation in a cancer cell line dataset highlights its reliability to accurately estimate tumor admixtures. We extended the capability of {PAMES} to the analysis of {CpG} islands instead of the more platform-specific {CpG} sites and demonstrated its accuracy in a set of advanced tumors profiled by high throughput {DNA} methylation sequencing. These analyses show that {PAMES} is a valuable tool to assess the purity of tumor samples in the settings of clinical research and diagnostics.https://github.com/cgplab/{PAMESSupplementary} data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {De novo biocatalysts with non-natural functionality are accessible by computational enzyme design. The catalytic activities obtained for the initial designs are usually low, but can be optimized signiﬁcantly by directed evolution. Nevertheless, rate accelerations approaching the level of natural enzymes can only be achieved over many rounds of tedious and time-consuming laboratory evolution. In this work, we show that microﬂuidic-based screening using ﬂuorescence-activated droplet sorting ({FADS}) is ideally suited for efﬁcient optimization of designed enzymes with low starting activity, essentially straight out of the computer. We chose the designed retro-aldolase {RA}95.0, which had been previously evolved by conventional microtiter plate screening, as an example and reoptimized it using the microﬂuidic-based assay. Our results show that {FADS} is sufﬁciently sensitive to detect enzyme activities as low as kcat/Km = 0.5 M−1s−1. The ultra-high throughput of this system makes screening of large mutant libraries possible in which clusters of up to ﬁve residues are randomized simultaneously. Thus, combinations of beneﬁcial mutations can be identiﬁed directly, leading to large jumps in catalytic activity of up to 80-fold within a single round of evolution. By exploring several evolutionary trajectories in parallel, we identify alternative active site arrangements that exhibit comparably enhanced efﬁciency but opposite enantioselectivity.},

	abstract = {With the advent of array-based techniques to measure methylation levels in primary tumor samples, systematic investigations of methylomes have widely been performed on a large number of tumor entities. Most of these approaches are not based on measuring individual cell methylation but rather the bulk tumor sample {DNA}, which contains a mixture of tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells and other stromal components. This raises questions about the purity of a certain tumor sample, given the varying degrees of stromal infiltration in different entities. Previous methods to infer tumor purity require or are based on the use of matching control samples which are rarely available. Here we present a novel, reference free method to quantify tumor purity, based on two Random Forest classifiers, which were trained on {ABSOLUTE} as well as {ESTIMATE} purity values from {TCGA} tumor samples. We subsequently apply this method to a previously published, large dataset of brain tumors, proving that these models perform well in datasets that have not been characterized with respect to tumor purity .},

Incorporation of the stabilizer immediately upstream of a picoinjector or a combination of injectors greatly reduces pressure fluctuations enabling reproducible and effective picoinjection in systems where the pressure varies actively during operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the pressure stabilizer for an integrated platform for on-demand encapsulation of bacterial cells followed by picoinjection of reagents for lysing the encapsulated cells. The pressure stabilizer was also used for picoinjection of multiple displacement amplification ({MDA}) reagents to achieve genomic {DNA} amplification of lysed bacterial cells.},

An important method for accomplishing this is picoinjection, a technique in which reagents are injected into aqueous drops using an electric field. While picoinjection has been shown to allow the precise addition of reagents to drops, its compatibility with biological reactions is yet to be thoroughly demonstrated. Here, we investigate the compatibility of picoinjection with digital {RT}-{PCR} Taqman assays, reactions that incorporate nucleic acids, enzymes, and other common biological reagents. We find that picoinjection is compatible with this assay and enables the detection of {RNA} transcripts at rates comparable to workflows not incorporating picoinjection.

	abstract = {As principal degrading enzymes of the extracellular matrix, metalloproteinases ({MPs}) contribute to various pathologies and represent a family of promising drug targets and biomarker candidates. However, multiple proteases and endogenous inhibitors interact to govern {MP} activity, often leading to highly context-dependent protease function that unfortunately has impeded associated clinical utility. We present a method for rapidly assessing the activity of multiple specific proteases in small volumes ({\textless}20 μL) of complex biological fluids such as clinical samples that are available only in very limited amounts. It uses a droplet-based microfluidic platform that injects the sample into thousands of picoliter-scale droplets from a barcoded droplet library ({DL}) containing mixtures of unique, moderately selective {FRET}-based protease substrates and specific inhibitors and monitors hundreds of the reactions thus initiated simultaneously by tracking these droplets. Specific protease activities in the sample are then inferred from the reaction rates using a deconvolution technique, proteolytic activity matrix analysis ({PrAMA}). Using a nine-member {DL} with three inhibitors and four {FRET} substrates, we applied the method to the peritoneal fluid of subjects with and without the invasive disease endometriosis. The results showed clear and physiologically relevant differences with disease, in particular, decreased {MMP}-2 and {ADAM}-9 activities.},

	abstract = {Evolution is essential to the generation of complexity and ultimately life. It relies on the propagation of the properties, traits, and characteristics that allow an organism to survive in a challenging environment. It is evolution that shaped our world over about four billion years by slow and iterative adaptation. While natural evolution based on selection is slow and gradual, directed evolution allows the fast and streamlined optimization of a phenotype under selective conditions. The potential of directed evolution for the discovery and optimization of enzymes is mostly limited by the throughput of the tools and methods available for screening. Over the past twenty years, versatile tools based on droplet microfluidics have been developed to address the need for higher throughput. In this Review, we provide a chronological overview of the intertwined development of microfluidics droplet-based compartmentalization methods and in vivo directed evolution of enzymes.},

	abstract = {Quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) has become the gold standard technique to measure {cDNA} and {gDNA} levels but the resulting data can be highly variable, artifactual and non-reproducible without appropriate verification and validation of both samples and primers. The root cause of poor quality data is typically associated with inadequate dilution of residual protein and chemical contaminants that variably inhibit Taq polymerase and primer annealing. The most susceptible, frustrating and often most interesting samples are those containing low abundant targets with small expression differences of 2-fold or lower. Here, Droplet Digital {PCR} ({ddPCR}) and {qPCR} platforms were directly compared for gene expression analysis using low amounts of purified, synthetic {DNA} in well characterized samples under identical reaction conditions. We conclude that for sample/target combinations with low levels of nucleic acids (Cq ≥ 29) and/or variable amounts of chemical and protein contaminants, {ddPCR} technology will produce more precise, reproducible and statistically significant results required for publication quality data. A stepwise methodology is also described to choose between these complimentary technologies to obtain the best results for any experiment.},

	abstract = {Using droplet microfluidic picoinjection as a reactant dosing technique is of great importance in assembling artificial cells and performing multistep reactions. However, the utilization of electricity in the existing picoinjection complicates the device fabrication and operation, and compromises the bioactivity of the encapsulated bio-ingredients. In this work, we propose an electricity-free picoinjection technique as an alternative to address these issues. Specifically, by precisely controlling the pressures inside the microfluidic channel, we can inject one reactant into the flowing droplets that contain another reactant without applying the electric field. Furthermore, the dosed volumes can be tuned by controlling the value of external pressure or the ratio of flow rates between the continuous and droplet phases. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed picoinjection, we apply it to synthesize crystals and nanoparticles. In the synthesis of crystals, the proposed picoinjection eliminates the problem of device fouling that occurs in the current reactant dosing devices. In the synthesis of nanoparticles, the proposed picoinjection generates nanoparticles that are highly monodispersed. As a result, this simplified picoinjection potentially extends the application of droplet microfluidics to investigate reaction dynamics or biochemical processes in cells. Besides, by eliminating the electricity, the proposed picoinjection avoids the usages of large equipment such as large power supplies or complicate devices, enhancing the accessibility of the proposed picoinjection.},

	abstract = {Microinjection is an effective actuation technique used for precise delivery of molecules and cells into droplets or controlled delivery of genes, molecules, proteins, and viruses into single cells. Several microinjection techniques have been developed for actuating droplets and cells. However, they are still time-consuming, have shown limited success, and are not compatible with the needs of high-throughput ({HT}) serial microinjection. We present a new passive microinjection technique relying on pressure-driven fluid flow and pulsative flow patterns within an {HT} droplet microfluidic system to produce serial droplets and manage rapid and highly controlled microinjection into droplets. A microneedle is secured within the injection station to confine droplets during the microinjection. The confinement of droplets on the injection station prevents their movement or deformation during the injection process. Three-dimensional (3D) computational analysis is developed and validated to model the dynamics of multiphase flows during the emulsion generation. We investigate the influence of pulsative flows, microneedle parameters and synchronization on the efficacy of microinjection. Finally, the feasibility of implementing our microinjection model is examined experimentally. This technique can be used for tissue engineering, cells actuation and drug discovery as well as developing new strategies for drug delivery.},
